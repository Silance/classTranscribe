# ClassTranscribe FAQ For New Instructors 

## What is the purpose of ClassTranscribe?

ClassTranscribe is an open-source, web-based platform that leverages crowdsourcing to address the problem of accurate, reliable and fast transcriptions of college lectures. Completed transcriptions provide search functionality that augments existing lecture recordings and enable enhanced educational features including closed captioning.

## Can I see the search?

You can search CS241 from Spring 2015 [here](http://classtranscribe.com/cs241). Try searching 'buffer overflow' or 'malloc'.

## How do I motivate students to complete tasks?

In the past professors have had success offering small (~1%) amounts of extra credit in exchange for completing a few tasks.

## How long does each task take?

About 20 minutes. You can view the process [here](https://github.com/cs-education/classTranscribe/blob/master/tutorial.md).

## How do I know which students particpated?
  At the end you will be provided with a CSV file containing netids along with the number of completed tasks.

## How do I sign up?

Send an email to classtranscribe@gmail.com indicating your interest. Please provide the following details:  
* number of students in the class
* whehther you have lecture recordings, flipped style content or both

I will then provide you with a Box folder to upload your videos. This is not restricted to classes where all video recordings already exist. Lectures can be uploaded and transcribed as they occur throughout the semester.

After your videos are turned into tasks you will be provided with an example email to send students notifying them about the process and providing tasks.


## Can I talk to a professor who has used ClassTranscribe previously?

Please contact us at classtranscribe@gmail.com and we will put you in touch an instructor.
