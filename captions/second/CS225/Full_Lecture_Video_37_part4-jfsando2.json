[{"text":"Last 2 digits.","width":121},{"text":"so you had to know your four's time tables pretty well right?","width":274},{"text":"Five?","width":130},{"text":"easiest one.","width":50},{"text":"yeah in the one's place.","width":123},{"text":"good.","width":38},{"text":"six?","width":128},{"text":"two and three.","width":80},{"text":"seven.","width":144},{"text":"nobody ever knew a rule for seven right?","width":188},{"text":"how about eight?","width":147},{"text":"was there a rule for eight or did teachers...","width":178},{"text":"Last three digits.","width":93},{"text":"oh boy.","width":24},{"text":"So you have to pull out your long division skills for that one almost no matter what okay.","width":296},{"text":"Or get to know your eight time tables pretty well.","width":144},{"text":"okay fine.","width":34},{"text":"How about nine?","width":123},{"text":"yeah sum of the digits again right.","width":158},{"text":"okay alright it's that whole seven thing that always bugged me a lot.","width":321},{"text":"because with eight you can like divide in half and then do the four trick right.","width":326},{"text":"Alright so the whole there is no rule for seven really was a problem for me in fourth grade.","width":764},{"text":"alright.","width":114},{"text":"Well it turns out that there is this nifty little graph that can help you with divisibility by seven.","width":566},{"text":"It is an algorithm for checking.","width":166},{"text":"I'm going to go through it really quickly.","width":199},{"text":"You will not be tested on this but it's kind of nifty.","width":209},{"text":"alright so you started the circle node at the top.","width":246},{"text":"So this is an example of a finite state machine.","width":234},{"text":"a particular kind of finite state machine of which a graph is a key component.","width":515},{"text":"For each digit d in the given number.","width":203},{"text":"Starting from the left as if the number is a string.","width":260},{"text":"Though i'm not sure it matters.","width":110},{"text":"It probably does matter actually.","width":87},{"text":"For each digit follow d blue edge and then after you do that follow a red edge.","width":640},{"text":"so its blue for the magnitude and then follow a red.","width":231},{"text":"so for example when i read the three I'm going to go one two three.","width":446},{"text":"got it?","width":55},{"text":"and then follow the red.","width":130},{"text":"So after the the three i'm in that state.","width":173},{"text":"Any question about it?","width":108},{"text":"Okay now let's do seven because this is fun.","width":157},{"text":"I'll do it in a different color even.","width":152},{"text":"Now we're going to do seven.","width":76},{"text":"Alright one two three four five six seven.","width":356},{"text":"oh look it brought me back to where i was.","width":146},{"text":"And then one.","width":101},{"text":"the red one to go here.","width":312},{"text":"Now zero.","width":34},{"text":"So i don't go anywhere but i do have to follow the red.","width":333},{"text":"and then three.","width":114},{"text":"one two three.","width":197},{"text":"Follow the red.","width":58},{"text":"oh look.","width":70},{"text":"if you end up back at the circle node, your number is divisible seven.","width":263},{"text":"yippeeeeee.","width":106},{"text":"yessss.","width":179},{"text":"not even kidding.","width":75},{"text":"alright any question about it?","width":351},{"text":"yeah?","width":159},{"text":"Did somebody get a PhD for this?","width":107},{"text":"probably not.","width":184},{"text":"[laugh] alright so you know.","width":140},{"text":"i'll tell you how you come up with it.","width":281},{"text":"It's cool.","width":62},{"text":"In CS what used to be three seventy three you studied these things.","width":305},{"text":"And this would have been a homework problem in that class.","width":188},{"text":"when it was offered a long time ago.","width":92},{"text":"i'm not sure they have time for fun little puzzles like this now.","width":443},{"text":"but yeah this is what do you think each vertex represents.","width":654},{"text":"mod seven very good.","width":343},{"text":"my guess is that three thousand is whatever the first one is mod seven.","width":858},{"text":"and then the seven gets you back to that same spot.","width":363},{"text":"is that right?","width":52},{"text":"it takes you once all the way around.","width":123},{"text":"oh and then one more.","width":67},{"text":"so i don't know exactly.","width":168},{"text":"but it has to do with the values mod seven together with the divisibility of powers of ten mod seven.","width":607},{"text":"a number theory class would also make this pretty clear probably.","width":262},{"text":"Alright any other questions about this?","width":174},{"text":"To graphs!","width":43},{"text":"Look it's a graph.","width":52},{"text":"these are graph applications.","width":88},{"text":"who knew?","width":82},{"text":"you could write code to do this super fast.","width":165},{"text":"oh when i first got here.","width":124},{"text":"The faculty person who ended up being my adviser and who is now a friend told me that finite state machines were just programs.","width":753},{"text":"And I went what on earth are you talking about?","width":276},{"text":"One of them is this commonatorial structure that you could build pictures out of.","width":436},{"text":"and one of them is a way of speaking.","width":176},{"text":"a way of controlling data.","width":128},{"text":"They can't possibly be the same thing.","width":250},{"text":"but he's right of course.","width":184},{"text":"Advisors always are.","width":172},{"text":"No not true but in this case he was.","width":226},{"text":"That basically you're changing the state of your system conditionally.","width":402},{"text":"If you see a three, you increase something by three.","width":335},{"text":"Or whatever you see here is the value you use to increment the state of the diagrams.","width":720},{"text":"So there's code all over the place there and i'm pretty sure you could actually write the code to do this by looking at the diagram.","width":599},{"text":"okay any questions about it?","width":149}]
