[{"text":"Yep, yep, Yes.","width":227},{"text":"Alright.","width":84},{"text":"Any other questions about this?","width":93},{"text":"Do you want to review another example?","width":141},{"text":"No, not necessarily.","width":521},{"text":"So the question is, do the values inside here.","width":350},{"text":"Do the values represent the height?","width":158},{"text":"They happen to represent the height in this particular example.","width":297},{"text":"Actually they don't quite represent the height.","width":455},{"text":"So if these were student names.","width":186},{"text":"Except for this one.","width":68},{"text":"These would be roots.","width":115},{"text":"This says my parent is identifer one.","width":341},{"text":"Identifier's one's parent is a root.","width":269},{"text":"It has no parent.","width":126},{"text":"So the entries are identifiers.","width":267},{"text":"Anything else about this?","width":137},{"text":"Yeah, let's do one.","width":596},{"text":"No, there would be nothing to do.","width":135},{"text":"Because they are already in the same set.","width":382},{"text":"Yep, Uhh, one two, yes.","width":234},{"text":"That's right.","width":39},{"text":"Because you only ever take the union of two different things.","width":278},{"text":"You might end up creating two different things.","width":307},{"text":"You might end up creating a loop, I don't know, ok?","width":339},{"text":"A union of a pair of things will still just be that thing.","width":203},{"text":"Just like sets.","width":61},{"text":"Just like the sets you've known since you were a third grader.","width":159},{"text":"Ok how are you doing?","width":209},{"text":"Any other examples here before we go to a bigger one?","width":213},{"text":"Ok, so let's clarify this and do it in a little bit larger of a context.","width":420},{"text":"We're going to the games.","width":197},{"text":"But notice, again.","width":207},{"text":"That there are no games.","width":97},{"text":"There is no indication of who likes which game.","width":203},{"text":"There is no angry birds appearing anywhere in the descriptions.","width":373},{"text":"If you re ascribing meaning to your sets, you have to keep that set separate.","width":507},{"text":"In fact when we use this structure which will happen in mp7.","width":283},{"text":"When we use this structure there is actually no meaning to the sets, there all just sort of a status.","width":538},{"text":"They keep track of a status.","width":168},{"text":"Ok, so let's draw a diagram.","width":182},{"text":"I have created the structure, in memory that denotes those sets.","width":591},{"text":"Ok, so this is what memory looks like.","width":223},{"text":"I want to draw the uptrees, the pictures of the uptrees that correspond to this memory, in what it looks like in the array.","width":709},{"text":"So zero's parent is?","width":288},{"text":"So zero's parent is?","width":174},{"text":"Four, ok.","width":114},{"text":"Four's parent is?","width":219},{"text":"Nobody, ok.","width":190},{"text":"So I've got zero done, I've got four done.","width":297},{"text":"Eight's parent is four.","width":276},{"text":"And one's parent is eight.","width":308},{"text":"And I just started with that one, because zero came first.","width":263},{"text":"That is the only reason.","width":140},{"text":"Two's parent is five and five is a root.","width":318},{"text":"Two's parent is five and five is a root.","width":347},{"text":"And nine's parent is five.","width":406},{"text":"Seven is a root by itself.","width":237},{"text":"Three's parent is six, which is a root.","width":339},{"text":"Ok?","width":153},{"text":"So now, what do I get back when I do a find of 4.","width":361},{"text":"If I do a find of 4, you go to 4 and you walk up, but there is no place to walk.","width":444},{"text":"So what do you return?","width":126},{"text":"4, is correct.","width":181},{"text":"Find of 8, returns.","width":220},{"text":"Ok we go to 8, it goes to 4, 4 is a root, so this returns 4.","width":444},{"text":"So this is true.","width":315},{"text":"Now this one get's interesting.","width":170},{"text":"This one gets interesting.","width":114},{"text":"How do we take the union.","width":174},{"text":"First of all, how do we evaluate this?","width":120},{"text":"What's the find of 7?","width":153},{"text":"What's the find of 2?","width":214},{"text":"Five.","width":34},{"text":"Are they the same?","width":185},{"text":"So, we should take the union of those which in this case, which will take this seven and point it to five.","width":652},{"text":"So, this seven is going to become five.","width":624},{"text":"No, it doesn't point to two.","width":402},{"text":"You always do the adjustment at the root.","width":121},{"text":"Raise your hand if this surprised you a bit.","width":300},{"text":"Because this is a ternary three rather than a binary tree.","width":525},{"text":"Oh my gosh.","width":88},{"text":"Oh my gosh.","width":350},{"text":"Ugh.","width":24},{"text":"Ok.","width":323}]
