gonna leave it like this.","width":87},{"text":"I don't want to like leave off by one errors there.","width":191},{"text":"Alright, how will we prove if that was true?","width":216},{"text":"This is my best out here.","width":91},{"text":"How do we prove that that's true?","width":95},{"text":"That this height is log n?","width":262},{"text":"No.","width":91},{"text":"Not induction yet.","width":116},{"text":"Not induction yet.","width":100},{"text":"First of all, what we're going to do is twist the question around to the minimum number of nodes in a tree of height h.","width":676},{"text":"Right?","width":27},{"text":"So twist the question around, answer that, prove that by induction and then invert it.","width":423},{"text":"So the maximum height of a complete tree containing n nodes.","width":289},{"text":"We're gonna say the minimum number of nodes in a tree of height h.","width":919},{"text":"We're gonna ask the inverse question.","width":276},{"text":"Alright.","width":64},{"text":"Fine.","width":53},{"text":"Log n.","width":94},{"text":"Algorithms that traverse height to to top root to leaf are going to be log n.","width":326},{"text":"Fine.","width":43},{"text":"How do we insert into this structure?","width":185},{"text":"Now here i'll draw this like this.","width":174},{"text":"This zero.","width":52},{"text":"This doesn't work anymore.","width":75},{"text":"Don't look at it.","width":121},{"text":"alright here's what i want to know from you.","width":162},{"text":"Tell me a number that would a key would be super easy to insert into this structure.","width":522},{"text":"Super easy to insert.","width":186},{"text":"Tell me a key that would be super easy to insert.","width":266},{"text":"Yeah?","width":108},{"text":"13 would be super easy to insert.","width":181},{"text":"Where does it go?","width":50},{"text":"It goes into seven's right.","width":305},{"text":"Right here.","width":49},{"text":"Right?","width":43},{"text":"The reason it's super easy to insert is.","width":435},{"text":"it's greater than seven so its correct and its easy to insert because it's something that goes right here into the array.","width":649},{"text":"Okay fine.","width":102},{"text":"Anyhting that is greater than seven and is gonna be can go in that spot and that spot corresponds to this cell.","width":703},{"text":"Okay.","width":34},{"text":"Good observation so three thousand would be enough.","width":204},{"text":"The smallest one would be eight but it's already in the tree.","width":265},{"text":"Alright so 10 might be the smallest one.","width":209},{"text":"Okay fine.","width":129},{"text":"I'm going to insert ohhh i don't know.","width":153},{"text":"You want five?","width":67},{"text":"That's what I was going to say.","width":309},{"text":"Really?","width":62},{"text":"okay.","width":133},{"text":"Yeah I'm telling you, the E.S.P runs strong in this room.","width":200},{"text":"I want to insert five.","width":80},{"text":"Do you like it?","width":327},{"text":"(Crowd says no).","width":97},{"text":"Okay you don't like it because it breaks the heap property.","width":577},{"text":"Where that property is an order a monotonically increasing path from root to the leaves.","width":595},{"text":"So how can I fix it?","width":295},{"text":"Swap.","width":38},{"text":"Very good observation.","width":150},{"text":"Look.","width":91},{"text":"I can just.","width":84},{"text":"it is safe.","width":102},{"text":"it is safe for me to swap five and seven here.","width":411},{"text":"right?","width":76},{"text":"Because if.","width":166},{"text":"if five is less than seven then it's certainly less than eleven because eleven is greater than seven.","width":615},{"text":"right.","width":73},{"text":"So if five is less than seven then it's an okay parent for it's sibling.","width":349},{"text":"Wait.","width":97},{"text":"It's an okay parent for the other side of the tree.","width":257},{"text":"Okay.","width":49},{"text":"Alright fine.","width":52},{"text":"So that was a safe thing to do.","width":113},{"text":"Are we done?","width":31},{"text":"Oh what should we do?","width":205},{"text":"Do it again.","width":97},{"text":"That's right.","width":50},{"text":"Is it safe for me to swap five up to here?","width":282},{"text":"Wait a minute.","width":109},{"text":"Two things are going one.","width":119},{"text":"I believe.","width":66},{"text":"I believe you understand it's okay to bring five up but is it okay to bring six down to this spot.","width":607},{"text":"Is it okay?","width":183},{"text":"Anything less than the previous key is okay.","width":252},{"text":"And we know six is less than seven because we learned it when we were two.","width":451},{"text":"But we know six is less than seven because it was above it in the tree.","width":266},{"text":"And this was a heap to start with.","width":134},{"text":"Okay.","width":18},{"text":"So it's okay to bring six down.","width":147},{"text":"And now the heap property.","width":238},{"text":"This property of a path increasing path from root to leaf is restored.","width":299},{"text":"Any question about it?","width":188},{"text":"That process.","width":62},{"text":"That swapping process we refer to as heapify up.","width":787}]
