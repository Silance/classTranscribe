[{"text":"Class is at 11 o'clock.","width":598},{"text":"Umm, let's see.","width":435},{"text":"All right.","width":88},{"text":"So umm, this is what I'm talking about.","width":651},{"text":"So raise your hand if you went to football game.","width":276},{"text":"Ok.","width":25},{"text":"So e, a student section was full.","width":236},{"text":"A student section was like more full than the stadium.","width":243},{"text":"Yes!","width":34},{"text":"Way to go.","width":69},{"text":"Umm, I wasn't there, cause it was my mother in law's 80 years' birthday parties.","width":299},{"text":"So you know, call it family politics.","width":270},{"text":"Umm, but this is what it was like in the pre game.","width":160},{"text":"It was a big party.","width":89},{"text":"So somebody who went, somebody raise your hand again if you went to the football game.","width":234},{"text":"Was it blast?","width":102},{"text":"Yeah, and we won't talk about the outcome.","width":188},{"text":"I will tell you though, I will tell you that my mother in law's 80 years' birthday party was in Wisconsin.","width":661},{"text":"So I was hearing, you know, I was hearing the game updates from the wrong side.","width":396},{"text":"The whole time my husband was looking at me like hahaha.","width":399},{"text":"So, you know, family, family complexitiies.","width":317},{"text":"All right, so, let's go

you know, all of our good attentions have gone a waste here.","width":391},{"text":"We are going to do a big exam.","width":200},{"text":"This is known as the tree exam.","width":153},{"text":"So all the questions on this, almost all the questions on this exam will be related to trees in one way or another.","width":516},{"text":"Umm, though it will also include maybe a little bit more series treatment of stacks and queues.","width":479},{"text":"You should notice that Level Order Traversals, Level Order Traversal is a great way for me to ask you both about queues and about some related to trees and about MP4.","width":957},{"text":"So make sure you really, make sure you see the connections betweeen, umm, queues and stacks as well actually.","width":592},{"text":"And traversal of trees and MP4.","width":187},{"text":"Cause that is a sort of very rich set of topics around which we can build questions.","width":392},{"text":"Now, I don't say that with any knowedge of what the exam looks like.","width":256},{"text":"I don't even writing the exams.","width":114},{"text":"So I'm just saying that if I were you, that would be one area of sort of integrated learning you might take pretty seriously.","width":640},{"text":"And then on this end of things that's the beginning, the stacks and queues was the kind of the beginning.","width":336},{"text":"We also have not yet test you on iterators in any reasonable way.","width":280},{"text":"So I would expect multiple choice question or something related to iteration and generic programming in c++.","width":557},{"text":"Umm, also let's see, umm, oh on this end of things, all the way through Friday's lecture on this week will be on the exam.","width":761},{"text":"So we'll finish up B trees on Friday.","width":202},{"text":"We are finishing AVL trees today.","width":178},{"text":"We are gonna do B trees Wednesday and Friday.","width":231},{"text":"And then there will be this kind of queen break away from trees.","width":323},{"text":"Ok.","width":76},{"text":"Umm let's see.","width":84},{"text":"And we'll be providing you opportunities for review.","width":302},{"text":"And we usually do an MP5 solution party right, you know, in those few days between MP5 and exam.","width":571},{"text":"Umm, what else, you can do your own MP4 solution party if you like.","width":442},{"text":"It's not as complex as MP5.","width":241},{"text":"All right, umm, I'm gonna save playing around with the [o no heck].","width":499},{"text":"Let's just do it.","width":261},{"text":"Slide this, hoho, and go here, and go here.","width":561},{"text":"Oh, yeah it's this.","width":200},{"text":"And now I'm actually going to turn on AVL.","width":197},{"text":"Ok.","width":16},{"text":"So last time we talked about fondamental algorithms for, fondamental algorithms for maintaining balance in a tree.","width":720},{"text":"Today we are gonna actually write the code or I'm gonna show you the written code for [insortion], Am I believe removal happens in labs.","width":591},{"text":"I believe you write the code for removal in lab.","width":202},{"text":"Umm, but ohh hey.","width":543},{"text":"look.","width":43},{"text":"ok.","width":21},{"text":"I can recover.","width":234},{"text":"like this.","width":56},{"text":"Oh and we are good to sound this light.","width":786},{"text":"ok.","width":39},{"text":"Come on everybody.","width":674},{"text":"Everybody's happy.","width":232},{"text":"Everything is awsome.","width":1128}]
