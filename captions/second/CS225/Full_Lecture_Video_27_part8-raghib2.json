[{"text":"Yup, yeah yeah.","width":105},{"text":"So he's asking about how many helper functions you need for this.","width":230},{"text":"I need one for height, I need one for balance factor, I need one..","width":257},{"text":"I need four for the, uh..","width":213},{"text":"four for the rotation cases.","width":133},{"text":"Yeah, that's a lot but yeah.","width":256},{"text":"I need those constructors and you know, this is..","width":168},{"text":"this is what we're good at this point.","width":130},{"text":"This is what's gonna get you a gazillion dollars, but not me.","width":257},{"text":"Okay...","width":26},{"text":"Alright, AVL tree removal.","width":582},{"text":"What happens if I remove nine?","width":644},{"text":"Oh......","width":6},{"text":"[gibberish].","width":456},{"text":"Oh yeah okay.","width":72},{"text":"First of all, is this tree in balance?","width":84},{"text":"Is this a balanced tree?","width":156},{"text":"Yes it is.","width":43},{"text":"Okay, there is nothing obviously out of balance I don't think.","width":256},{"text":"You can pretty much eyeball it here.","width":114},{"text":"What happens if I remove nine?","width":476},{"text":"It's even better, I got a better one.","width":152},{"text":"What happens if I remove ten?","width":147},{"text":"Ha ha.","width":129},{"text":"Yeah.","width":389},{"text":"Alright.","width":110},{"text":"Alright.","width":29},{"text":"So lets trace this a second.","width":144},{"text":"This is just an example.","width":115},{"text":"I wanna remove, I'll remove nine.","width":151},{"text":"Ten is structurally the same.","width":148},{"text":"Okay.","width":45},{"text":"So we remove nine and we have every reason to believe, we have every reason to believe the process for removal mimics that of insert, that is that we can kind of test after we change the structure of the tree wether or not a rotation is necessary.","width":1009},{"text":"Now what's interesting about this of course, is that binary search tree removal invokes an in order predecessor, which invokes..","width":519},{"text":"may invoke further cutting off of the tree and so actually it's not even just in the um removal where you need this checking of height but also um in the..","width":912},{"text":"in order predecessor evaluation portion.","width":232},{"text":"So, but, we're not gonna do those details here, that's for lab.","width":272},{"text":"For now, we're just gonna remove nine.","width":149},{"text":"So now my question is what kind of rotation fixes this tree?","width":559},{"text":"Some kind of left rotation, correct?","width":212},{"text":"Some kind of left rotation.","width":112},{"text":"Which kind of left rotation?","width":183},{"text":"Single or double?","width":103},{"text":"Double, that's right!","width":105},{"text":"Because at that point the balance factor here, the balance factor here would be two, the balance factor here would be negative one.","width":609},{"text":"And so its a left right rotation that's necessary.","width":278},{"text":"Oh that's why.","width":100},{"text":"Because here you can use the same balance factor function ha ha I see.","width":260},{"text":"So in the end, after we do this, I'm gonna put this in red because you'll be able to see it, you'll be able to see what happens.","width":524},{"text":"In the end, I'm going to have eleven here, ten there, and twelve here, still.","width":547},{"text":"Okay.","width":61},{"text":"And this will be gone because the rotation will result in this.","width":213},{"text":"And then we will complete execution of that recursive call and come here and what happens?","width":780},{"text":"Oh.....","width":165},{"text":"Now it's out of balance.","width":182},{"text":"Okay, you see that?","width":210},{"text":"Because it's long on this side, we've shortened one that was barely long enough right?","width":388},{"text":"This side was barely long enough and we've shortened it.","width":232},{"text":"So that creates another imbalance.","width":139},{"text":"So what kind of rotation is gonna fix it?","width":193},{"text":"A right rotation, right!","width":355},{"text":"Yes.","width":70},{"text":"Very good.","width":59},{"text":"And what do you think?","width":144},{"text":"A right...","width":34},{"text":"or a double or a single?","width":230},{"text":"Single, I think either one of them works in this case but..","width":194},{"text":"we might as well go single here, right?","width":128},{"text":"So, it's going to result in a right rotation about eight.","width":311},{"text":"Now, think about it.","width":124},{"text":"This tree rooted at 8 might barely have been long enough and we shortened it.","width":458},{"text":"Okay, it might be a subtree.","width":244},{"text":"This..","width":6},{"text":"this tree that I have painted here might be a subtree in some larger structure and it might barely have been long enough, tall enough and we just shortened it.","width":748},{"text":"So it's possible that actually fixing things at eight would cause the need for rotation farther up the structure.","width":590},{"text":"So it is possible in fact that when you do a removal, you may have to do rotations all the way up the tree.","width":473},{"text":"Okay, any question about that?","width":103},{"text":"You see how that's possible?","width":125},{"text":"Okay...","width":62},{"text":"uhh..","width":29},{"text":"let's move on.","width":71},{"text":"We'll see how far we get here.","width":184},{"text":"Just a little bit.","width":146},{"text":"So....","width":146}]
