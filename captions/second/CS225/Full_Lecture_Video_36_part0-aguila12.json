to change them.","width":225},{"text":"Those are Tuesdays, right?","width":132},{"text":"OK.","width":46},{"text":"There we go.","width":61},{"text":"Alright.","width":54},{"text":"Yes?","width":8},{"text":"[student question] There is new on the exam, thank you for asking, [uhm].","width":393},{"text":"Alright so [uhm].","width":196},{"text":"You should be receiving your scores back in your svn our intet..","width":356},{"text":"our plan was to create a folder in your repository mt2 and in it you will have the scanned copy of your exam, so you can see your work.","width":661},{"text":"[uhh] And a report that tells you how you did on each of the scantron and the hand graded [huh] portion of the test.","width":770},{"text":"Now [uhh..] Also simultaneously the rubric will be posted so you can go and look and see how the graders decided how many points you should achieve for each part.","width":714},{"text":"Now this is, none of this is what you want to hear, right?","width":195},{"text":"What is it that you want to hear?","width":110},{"text":"[student ask when?] Oh, when?","width":141},{"text":"It should be, it might be happening as we speak.","width":140},{"text":"He said, He said do you want me to push the button before lecture, I'm like [uhhh] I dont know how to make that decision.","width":471},{"text":"So he, I think he was going to send it out momentarily.","width":259},{"text":"[Uhm.] [student voice] Yeah.","width":605},{"text":"Ah regrades are going to be, very good question, so the regrades are going to be, we're leaving it up to the individual TAs to handle it but if it appears that they are going to tell you large windows of time that they're available and you can come talk to them with your exam in front of you, because they where all scanned so [uhm..] You can ask for regrades inside those windows.","width":1581},{"text":"They're expecting to be able to take care of them that way rather than putting piles in my office.","width":471},{"text":"There's another key question you're not asking, Yeah?","width":363},{"text":"I know...","width":128},{"text":"I know..","width":85},{"text":"[uhm] so the average on the exam for this exam typically goes up from the first exam.","width":505},{"text":"The average was 68..","width":299},{"text":"The last average was 75 So uhm.","width":273},{"text":"So heres the heres the heres the parting line we do not curve, we do not curve individual assessments in this course OK.","width":564},{"text":"[huh.] But we are open to adjusting the grade cutoff at the end of the semester so in your, so in your [sidekey?] you should still imagine the ohhhh..","width":842},{"text":"this exam, you know.","width":64},{"text":"If you aren't happy with your score, you should go ohhh I gotta keep working really hard [uhm] because there are sort of no automatic you know ohh don't worry about it's really 7 points higher im not doing that OK.","width":824},{"text":"But, but in the end you know I like to see lots of A's and so at that point we will change the, where we draw the line in the grading moment.","width":810},{"text":"OK.","width":70},{"text":"Any questions about that?","width":134},{"text":"I also toyed with the possibility of figuring out additional ways to do extra credit.","width":335},{"text":"But in my experience extra credit helps the students who most, who have extra time and the, the students who have extra time tend to be those who don't need the extra credit.","width":956},{"text":"So I'm torn on you know building in additional work to do.","width":388},{"text":"[uhm] I don't know I'm still thinking about that.","width":411},{"text":"So [uhh] I haven't looked at histograms on individual problems yet, so I don't know, you know, i don't know yet how they each look.","width":533},{"text":"I will do so just to make sure that's typically how I make sure that the scantrons are graded accurately.","width":380},{"text":"To look at histograms and see if they make sense.","width":187},{"text":"Alright any other questions about tests?","width":200},{"text":"[uhm] I think its not premature for me to talk about the final just a little bit.","width":289},{"text":"Here's how you should think about the final in this class [uhm].","width":220},{"text":"It is a third midterm with a tree question, an interesting tree question and [uhmmm] probably a little bit of memory management on the multiple choice so its really like a third midterm the bulk of your studying should be on the material you that have not yet been tested over and [uhm] and then, you know, make sure, just kind of revisit some of the earlier material.","width":2027},{"text":"Are there any questions?","width":120},{"text":"administrative questions?","width":151},{"text":"[uhm] yeah Arma?","width":278},{"text":"[student asks
