[{"text":"alright all of these have stories I think this is why I meant to do this Alright so here's another graph You've probably seen Uhm graph like this before This is a surface mesh Uhhh Of a little thing okay a surface mesh The data set itself Which is really just The vertices here The data set itself is a classic data set Used in uhm Graphics algorithms Used as a bench mark for any kind of new graphics algorithms That anybody ever wants to do So they refer to the data set itself as the Stanford bunny For obvious reason, it came I mean it happen to have originated at Stanford In their graphics research group And examples of it is used a bench are of there was somebody testing out to see how Lighting source works with this shiny texture that they are mapping on something You know hair is the hardest thing to model and so it's very common attempts at modeling hair Graphically, and the graph part of this Is really fascinating, so this data set is way way way way too dense IT has way too many vertices so the goal is to come up with a reasonable way of shrinking that data set into something practical so you can pop away quickly or something you can animate, most specifically something that can be animated, for example And then to use the triangulation, the triangle mesh between the vertices As surfaces on which to build your graphic application so sitting that shiny bunny is actually a whole bunch triangles, each of which has coloring mapped onto it in a particular way based on physics, the physics of light and color Okay and movement and angle and lots of different things Okay, so uhhh the goal then is in computational Geometry is to a data set and to shrink it down in a meaningful way Now this bunny is created with a pretty good algorithm because in areas of high curvature there are still lots of points but in areas of low curvature, you know, across the back of bunny There aren't many points, that is the triangles themselves are fairly close to the actual surface of the bunny Any question about that?","width":11949},{"text":"so this is cool When I first came to grad school, this is what I thought I wanted to do because it's just fun to think about Okay, so the graph itself is the vertices that actually do lie on the surfaces of some bunny, somewhere history and the edges are created arithmetically to represent the surface of the bunny to be representatives of the surface bunny now so what's the rest of the story?","width":1798},{"text":"The rest of the story is that I was at my aunt's house I was in Seratoga, California which is kinda close to Stanford.","width":561},{"text":"And we're in her family room ,it's a family gathering, I haven't seen her in a long time it was great, sitting in the family room looking at her bookshelf, and there is THE Stanford bunny.","width":1044},{"text":"Like the little terracotta bunny.","width":190},{"text":"I had only ever seen it in that form.","width":333},{"text":"And I gasped.","width":304},{"text":"I'm like *gasped* It's the nearest thing to fame I've ever experienced And after I woke up, no I didn't really pass out Well it turns out the bunny is just some mass produced lawn ornament.","width":1201},{"text":"There are probably thousands of them.","width":243},{"text":"Especially in bay area lawn ornaments stores or something like that, BUT just for a moment there, I thought I was in the presence of greatness.","width":946},{"text":"Alright any questions?","width":315},{"text":"So if you are interested in computational geometry or graphics, of course there are experts in our department who would be VERY happy to talk to you Alright.","width":1187}]
