quickly.","width":342},{"text":"I tried to do it in powerpoint and I'm not a powerpoint user.","width":390},{"text":"So I failed.","width":106},{"text":"So here is running time of our function.","width":192},{"text":"Here is the running time of our algorithm.","width":296},{"text":"This is the function reflect it.","width":137},{"text":"We don't necessarily know how it's characterized.","width":202},{"text":"We don't know it has to do with all kinds of things that are not necessary.","width":355},{"text":"We don't know necessarily what kind of function it looks like.","width":397},{"text":"But we have a feeling that there is this other function somewhere that we can use to reflect the running time of our function.","width":674},{"text":"We also don't know what this function looks like.","width":168},{"text":"It might look like something like that.","width":221},{"text":"In fact this one is what we do know what it looks like.","width":237},{"text":"In the case of this particular example, we are going to argue that the running time is log in the size of the data.","width":720},{"text":"The reason we suspect that's appropriate running time is because of the structure of our tree.","width":542},{"text":"Because the heights of the balanced binary trees.","width":193},{"text":"We didn't just pull this out of the air.","width":246},{"text":"It was sort of a good guess based on the way our tree split our data in half.","width":567},{"text":"In fact, for regular binary trees we couldn't say this.","width":205},{"text":"We couldn't say logn here for regular binary search trees.","width":299},{"text":"We couldn't guess logn.","width":135},{"text":"We couldn't prove it.","width":112},{"text":"But in the definition here, we allow for some.","width":562},{"text":"We allow for some function, whatever it is, to be pushed up by some constant scale factor.","width":510},{"text":"Positive scale factor whose intention is to push that function up for a little bit.","width":621},{"text":"We also allow for some muss at the start.","width":332},{"text":"I'm going to draw some c times g of n in kind of exaggerate because there is something I want to illustrate very concretely on this picture.","width":743},{"text":"So I'm going to draw the c times g of n sort of like this.","width":652},{"text":"So this is c times g of n.","width":267},{"text":"Maybe I have g of n drawn poorly.","width":188},{"text":"Doesn't matter much.","width":156},{"text":"OK.","width":17},{"text":"So now is f of n greater than c times g of n?","width":342},{"text":"Sorry, is f of n greater than c times g of n?","width":202},{"text":"Like we want in this inequality is that f of n less than c times g of n.","width":495},{"text":"Sometimes it's the right answer.","width":116},{"text":"Sometimes it's forever less than eventually forever less than...","width":580},{"text":"yes.","width":29},{"text":"So we have a bound here

this should be done carefully in 173 I don't know if it is or not.","width":312},{"text":"I'm doing it here carefully because we are going to it turns out that making this less than or equal to

completely invert this picture.","width":206},{"text":"I haven't practiced it for a while.","width":147},{"text":"It has been four years since I drawn this picture.","width":157},{"text":"So let's see if I can do it.","width":154},{"text":"So where is f of n go now?","width":285},{"text":"In the inverted picture.","width":77},{"text":"It goes like this, right?","width":73},{"text":"Is that what f of n looks like?","width":517},{"text":"g of n as I have drawn here.","width":419},{"text":"It goes a little bit farther from the axis and stays forever on the back side of the f of n.","width":521},{"text":"So g of n looks like this.","width":224},{"text":"Right?","width":85},{"text":"And c times g of n now looks like this.","width":504},{"text":"Yes?","width":55},{"text":"Did I do it right?","width":959}]
