[{"text":"Okay so or forwards or backwards right?","width":197},{"text":"There is no turning it's plastic, if you tried to turn these cars they'll break.","width":311},{"text":"Right.","width":64},{"text":"So each car can only go, you're trying to get the red car out, and each car can only move forward and backward it's a little puzzle.","width":467},{"text":"Alright, so the question is what's the graph?","width":119},{"text":"Now remember, remember, that to describe a graph, means to tell what the vertices represent and what the edges represent.","width":612},{"text":"So what the heck is that graph?","width":244},{"text":"You're welcome to come up here closer if you can't see very well from back there.","width":285},{"text":"You're just welcome to stand right up and come and look if you like.","width":189},{"text":"Let me see how well you can see.","width":151},{"text":"Can you see very well?","width":281},{"text":"Kind of, okay.","width":53},{"text":"Where it looks like there might be an edge between them, pretend there is.","width":248},{"text":"What is the graph what are the vertices, and what are the edges?","width":286},{"text":"And then I'm gonna ask what are the green dots?","width":296},{"text":"Mmmmmm.","width":130},{"text":"Finishing positions is a good guess.","width":232},{"text":"It's a good guess.","width":152},{"text":"Yeah?","width":56},{"text":"Start with vertices.","width":411},{"text":"Yes, very good.","width":103},{"text":"So we say that the ver- each vertex is a state of the game, and that corresponds to a position, a set of positions, of all the cars.","width":667},{"text":"So presumably, that picture in the upper right hand corner, corresponds to one of the vertices in the graph.","width":574},{"text":"Okay?","width":13},{"text":"Any question about that?","width":386},{"text":"Yeah?","width":99},{"text":"Yes!","width":124},{"text":"Very good.","width":51},{"text":"So the edges between them are uh correspond to the ability to move from one position to another via a valid move.","width":697},{"text":"Okay?","width":25},{"text":"Alright, fine, What are the green dots?","width":314},{"text":"Yeah?","width":127},{"text":"Yeah!","width":14},{"text":"The path to completion, very good.","width":149},{"text":"So presumably this is the start configuration, and I'm guessing, I'm hoping, I guess, that in fact those green dots correspond to the shortest path to completion, okay?","width":1020},{"text":"And that blue up there is done.","width":225},{"text":"Alright, so what's with all of fan out up there, with all the different the fan out in the path?","width":386},{"text":"Somebody who plays the game, tell me what happens at the very end.","width":946},{"text":"Somebody who's played the game, tell me what happens at the very end.","width":761},{"text":"Yeah?","width":169},{"text":"[student response] Uh huh?","width":140},{"text":"Ah!","width":30},{"text":"Okay, so I think, that that corresponds to ending of over here, but I don't think it describes this stuff.","width":942},{"text":"Yeah?","width":228},{"text":"Yeah okay, so sort of.","width":409},{"text":"That's a little closer.","width":126},{"text":"So those are all the shortest paths so presumably you wouldn't have any kind of \"extra" moves.","width":370},{"text":"Gratuitous extra moves.","width":130},{"text":"The answer is when you're close to the end, there are lots of different ways to finish it off.","width":301},{"text":"Right, like you can move backward and, you know, I don't know.","width":248},{"text":"You can- you get to decide which one to move first and you know, you can finish the game up either way.","width":558},{"text":"So at the very end, there are lot more degrees of freedom to finishing the game efficiently, k?","width":359},{"text":"So this is a great game to play, while you're riding a bus, say over thanksgiving.","width":391},{"text":"I'm pretty sure there are mobile versions of it.","width":147},{"text":"In fact, all these think-fun puzzle games, are super fun and probably have mobile apps that correspond to them.","width":638},{"text":"Okay, uh I have a question for you, don't look at the graph yet, I have a question for you.","width":252},{"text":"When you were in about 4th grade, probably, your math teacher gave rules for checking for divisibility, right?","width":547},{"text":"What was the rule for checking to see if something was divisible by 2?","width":283},{"text":"Even, right, The, the one's digit was even.","width":229},{"text":"How about the rule for checking if something was divisible by 3?","width":372},{"text":"Some of the digits uh is a what?","width":234},{"text":"Divisible by 3- Oh my gosh, it's recursive!","width":161},{"text":"[students expressing stress at hearing recursive] You didn't know it!","width":257},{"text":"You were doing a recursive algorithm when you were in 3rd grade, right?","width":292},{"text":"Because what if the sum of the digits is 18?","width":225},{"text":"You added again, right?","width":108},{"text":"Ohoho, goosebumps, right here.","width":161},{"text":"Okay.","width":20},{"text":"Uhh alright, how about 4?","width":421}]
