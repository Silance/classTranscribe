[{"text":"Ok let's work.","width":399},{"text":"So I wanna talked for a minute about the exam coming up.","width":834},{"text":"Tuesday.","width":94},{"text":"So I wanna make sure you hear these words, the exam is on Tuesday, not Wednesday.","width":419},{"text":"Wednesday was pain in the ass we did like it very much.","width":249},{"text":"So we are moving it back to Tuesday.","width":285},{"text":"I'll leave it in red for you.","width":148},{"text":"Umm and the conflict exam should you needed is the following morning, so that will be Wednesday morning.","width":412},{"text":"Like to get all those taken before, umm, class meet.","width":216},{"text":"But we can be a little bit flexible inside the morning window, the larger morning window.","width":346},{"text":"Umm, let's see there will be reduce sessions this weekend and still waiting to hear from course staff when they would like to do them.","width":561},{"text":"Umm, and from room reservations actually with them we need to make the room reservations.","width":339},{"text":"Then we will let you know.","width":119},{"text":"So umm if you are not yet connected to the class on the piazza.","width":269},{"text":"Now it is the good time to do so.","width":90},{"text":"Because that's where we will announce it, that's where we will announce the review sessions this weekend.","width":401},{"text":"Umm, we talked about this moring in the format for the exams gonna be very similar to those of the pasting exams.","width":456},{"text":"Umm which means multiple choice, lots of running time questions.","width":285},{"text":"So we will paint a little scenario for you and ask how long will this take, how long will this take.","width":321},{"text":"Umm and let's see, and then a couple of programming questions or, you know, did understand the work you did for the MPs type questions.","width":650},{"text":"One thing that will be different is that there will be an exam booklet decoupled from the exam solution paper.","width":434},{"text":"So just sort doesn't surprise you.","width":101},{"text":"You will be writing your solutions on a page that we will been scaned for improve the effeciency in gradings.","width":438},{"text":"So don't let it surprise you when you get there and you exam booklet is seperate from your long solution paper even.","width":647},{"text":"Bubble sheet does well of course.","width":123},{"text":"Ok, I think that's all I'm wanna say about the exam today.","width":307},{"text":"Like I said, we will keep your priced of oppotunities for review.","width":294},{"text":"Are there administrative questions before I start?","width":187},{"text":"Do you have anything you wanna ask about it?","width":204},{"text":"I really told you anything so.","width":164},{"text":"The material to be covered is everything from stacks and queues through Friday and if I don't start on the material you'll miss out on the chance to be tested over B trees.","width":811},{"text":"So I'd better get started.","width":131},{"text":"Umm, last time we sort of refreshed our memory for the definition of big O.","width":429},{"text":"The key observation here is that we are looking at, we are trying to assess and upper bound on the running times of algorithms.","width":739},{"text":"So in this definition, f(n) represents the true running time of our algorithm.","width":496},{"text":"Ok?","width":13},{"text":"Represents the true running time of our algorithm.","width":216},{"text":"And g(n) is some function that we use to communicate its quality, the quality of the algorithm or the speed of the algorithm.","width":772},{"text":"Quality.","width":55},{"text":"Now, that's said, that's said, this inequality, this inequality allows us to make g as big as possible.","width":847},{"text":"Right?","width":23},{"text":"But, smaller is better when you talking about the quality of a running of an algorithm.","width":409},{"text":"So typically when we talked about the big O.","width":292},{"text":"And we have a function here.","width":183},{"text":"We want the lowest possible version of that function, the lowest possible of function that we can put in there.","width":456},{"text":"Ok?","width":37},{"text":"So we want, we say we want a tight bound, tight upper bound on the running time.","width":439},{"text":"Umm that is, again just re-iterate because we use this big O to reflect the quality of our algorithm.","width":567},{"text":"Nobody who can run a four-minute mile goes around saying \"Oh yeah, I can run a mile in less than eight minutes\", right?","width":608},{"text":"That's what I'm talking about here.","width":98},{"text":"They say \"Oh yeah, I can run a mile in less than four minutes.\" right?","width":211},{"text":"Like they get down as low as possible.","width":253}]
