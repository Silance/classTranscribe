[{"text":"On a tree...","width":341},{"text":"and this one is a characterization...","width":477},{"text":"of a tree...","width":180},{"text":"that uses that measurement.","width":105},{"text":"Okay?","width":14},{"text":"So, the...","width":79},{"text":"um...","width":47},{"text":"the vocabulary is the same, but there's a subtle difference in their application.","width":338},{"text":"Alright, so we say that a tree is height balanced if...","width":196},{"text":"uhh..if it's an empty tree, an empty tree is height balanced.","width":193},{"text":"Umm...","width":46},{"text":"or if it's not empty, then, you know, the recursive the recursive nature of this definition says that whatever is true for the entire tree must be true of the subtrees.","width":833},{"text":"And, I think, what you wanted me to write here is b=0, but I didn't.","width":684},{"text":"I wrote the absolute value of b is less than or equal to 1.","width":389},{"text":"So, rather than demanding...","width":161},{"text":"rather than demanding that a binary search tree be perfectly balanced, and all it's subtrees, we allow a little wishy-washyness, we allow a little bit of imbalance.","width":931},{"text":"And the question is whether that's a big sacrifice or whether it kinda gets us where we want.","width":369},{"text":"Uh, any questions about that before we go on?","width":152},{"text":"Okay, so...","width":84},{"text":"is the tree on the left, ignore the little trees, is the tree on the left height balanced?","width":1334},{"text":"Okay...","width":166},{"text":"I'll say no it's not.","width":100},{"text":"It is not height balanced.","width":91},{"text":"Now, I want you to find me this sub-the subtree that is not balanced.","width":402},{"text":"The subtree rooted at...51, very good!","width":271},{"text":"So take a look at 51, at that node.","width":221},{"text":"And what you observe is that, you know, the height of the left subtree is 0 and the height of the right subtree is 2.","width":413},{"text":"You know, I don't ever really think about the heights of those trees.","width":225},{"text":"I kinda eyeball it and look at the difference in the levels.","width":199},{"text":"Oh, look!","width":63},{"text":"There is a subtree where the left and the right different by 2.","width":296},{"text":"So, hence, this tree is not height balanced.","width":218},{"text":"Okay?","width":76},{"text":"Alright...","width":41},{"text":"uh...","width":41},{"text":"let's see..So what we're going to do what we're going to do moving forward is...","width":753},{"text":"um...","width":87},{"text":"take our earlier observation take our earlier observation that we prefer mountains to sticks.","width":592},{"text":"And we're going to view the change we're going to view it as an operation on the tree to go from a piece of a tree that looks like this to a piece of a tree that looks like this.","width":1087},{"text":"Okay?","width":59},{"text":"And the piece of the tree that looks like this is going to be based on the observation that this example tree is out of balance.","width":644},{"text":"And, by doing some little operation on the very same data, we create a tree that is very nicely balanced, thank you very much.","width":653},{"text":"So now let's apply that thought that impression to this tree.","width":430},{"text":"Where is the stick in this tree?","width":214},{"text":"Where is the stick that we might want to change?","width":183},{"text":"Where is the string of nodes all of which play into what might be con- what is an imbalance.","width":718},{"text":"Why there it is!","width":227},{"text":"Okay?","width":18},{"text":"So starting at the tre- node that is out of balance, the lowest node in the tree that's out of balance, because it's possible that there was another node out of balance.","width":575},{"text":"But starting at the lowest node in the tree that's out of balance, we're going to observe that anything that looks like this...","width":543},{"text":"if we applied this magic operation and just changed that portion of the tree, we could actually change the structure of the tree in a way that...","width":622},{"text":"um...","width":6},{"text":"reduces the height.","width":66},{"text":"Okay?","width":22},{"text":"And we're going to talk about how to do that in just a second.","width":136},{"text":"Alright, any questions about that?","width":165},{"text":"No, there are no technical details.","width":154},{"text":"By the end of the next slide, you will know how to do all the pointer assignments necessary in a pointer based tree to make that happen.","width":478},{"text":"So, if it feels technically a little mysterious right now...","width":239},{"text":"that's perfectly fine.","width":73},{"text":"Okay, i have another question for you...","width":175},{"text":"um...","width":12},{"text":"How would we asses...","width":176},{"text":"How would we find 51 and determine that it was out of balance.","width":463},{"text":"What would be an algorithm Just kind of a loose description of an algorithm to figure out whether or not 51 is out of balance?","width":736},{"text":"Eww, that's a hard problem, right?","width":518}]
