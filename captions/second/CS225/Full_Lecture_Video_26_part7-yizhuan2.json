[{"text":"and that's a really good news cause it means we can adjust the structure of tree by spending a little bit more time on our insertion and removals just quite complex but satisfying nonetheless yes!","width":975},{"text":"(students asking) so right very good so we are going to look at this but I am answering the question right now so we will wait a minute when you go back up the tree adjusting the height that is cost you time and the answer to that is that you will do that in the context of insertion right?","width":1158},{"text":"like all of this is happening in the context of some other manuplation on our tree like insertion so we've already spending the time navigating the height so yes we are going to spend a bit more time but not more time in the insertion would taken anyway ok?","width":1325},{"text":"so at each stage in the worst case we just gonna to do a rotation but it will still be only at every level of the tree in the worst case actually insertion there proves you to do at only once ok any question so far?","width":1031},{"text":"yes!","width":7},{"text":"(students asking) oh very good so the question is how to I choose seventy, forty and fifty?","width":650},{"text":"so there is a mystery here and I consider it to be diagnosing the need of the rotation ok and it is exactly the right question right like I don't know why I could observe that it is the bent thing instead of the straight thing except right now you do have the intuition that is too long in the middle ok we are gonna actually I think I have slide in two slides that help you to diagnosing exactly how you figure out which rotation to do ok so this is the exactly the right question to do alright so here is the summary here's we know so far there four kinds of rotations this one I should say this is an example of double rotation called a left-right rotation so left is like an left modifies right ok still a right rotation it just say lefty right rotation ok there are four kinds: the singles in each direction left-right and right-left ok they are all symmetric so that means that currently we are already know how to write the code for one of them they are local operation that is ABC and D and also all subtrees on the other side of the imbalanced subtree none of those are affected em and we are just readjusting the structure of binary search tree we are not breaking a binary search tree in any way ok?","width":7093},{"text":"alright.","width":38},{"text":"so our goal is to use these rotations to maintain the balance of a binary search tree em this particular height balanced tree these are called AVL trees where AVL they are a collection of initials for these guys whose name I always forget Adelson-Velsky and Landis two people and this was done in 1962 ok?","width":3043},{"text":"alright so here's I am gonna say about that so this is two people who did this there are particularly kind of tree there are other balanced trees you will see the references to red-black trees if an interview or if you are reading an research paper or somebody refers to red-black trees kind of quizzes about it you say in our discrete structure classes we did an AVL tree instead and oh you can get red-black trees if you know AVL trees when I took the theory classes when I took what's now 374 here decades ago they did red-black trees there and they may still I don't know for sure alright and the thing I'd like to point out is look this is not all that long ago this is a relatively short time ago it's kind of weird right?","width":3921},{"text":"like this is when your grandparents when they are in their height of career properly about "width":387}]
