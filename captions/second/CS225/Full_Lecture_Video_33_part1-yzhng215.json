lists.","width":144},{"text":"What distinguish one list from another.","width":149},{"text":"Yeah.","width":154},{"text":"No, these are more than primitives.","width":101},{"text":"Strings are not primitive.","width":85},{"text":"We treat them as primitives because we use them so much, but they certainly are not primitive to the language.","width":393},{"text":"In fact, I could put booleans in there, but it wouldn't be very interesting, wouldn't be very interesting to do so.","width":303},{"text":"Yeah.","width":197},{"text":"Uh, they have a somewhat obvious ordering.","width":221},{"text":"Very good observation.","width":100},{"text":"So the English description that he used was a somewhat obvious ordering and I really like that.","width":828},{"text":"The way we capture that observation using a vocabulary word in our domain is that the keys are comparable.","width":834},{"text":"So this list is consisted of types, key types that are comparable.","width":456},{"text":"Ok, any questions about that.","width":54},{"text":"So what does that mean in implementation.","width":769},{"text":"What does that mean implementation-wise for something to be comparable.","width":246},{"text":"This is a review from the last time.","width":106},{"text":"I actually said the answer to this question last time.","width":205},{"text":"What does that mean for things in the key in a key space to be comparable.","width":299},{"text":"Yeah.","width":119},{"text":"That's right.","width":35},{"text":"Operator \"less than\" is defined.","width":161},{"text":"So \"comparable" means, \"comparability" \"comparable" means.","width":830},{"text":"I don't know why.","width":256},{"text":"Ummmmm.","width":198},{"text":"OK.","width":47},{"text":"So this means \"less than\" operator is defined.","width":402},{"text":"You will write it more neatly on your own notes.","width":425},{"text":"Ok, anybody need clarification of that.","width":120},{"text":"It's not written very well.","width":81},{"text":"So don't look where I wrote it.","width":287},{"text":"Just think about what I wrote.","width":102},{"text":"\"Less than\" operator is defined.","width":163},{"text":"Now do you agree with me that the things in the \"NO" lists are not comparable.","width":345},{"text":"Do you agree with me What do you think.","width":827},{"text":"I'm sorry.","width":59},{"text":"Now you trick me.","width":121},{"text":"Now you are in the dog house.","width":1169},{"text":"Yes, Mike.","width":281},{"text":"Good, very good.","width":64},{"text":"So this, this quick, quick, quick response from me to say \"no, those are not comparable.","width":350},{"text":"I didn't think deeply about it and you can impose a matrix, you can impose a matrix on lots of different types that force them to be comparable.","width":681},{"text":"But these just in standard are not.","width":195},{"text":"For example, for PNGs, in fact, this is going to be relevant in MP6.","width":424},{"text":"You end up using the average color value of a PNG to enforce a sort of comparability in it.","width":621},{"text":"Ok.","width":27},{"text":"So you use average, an average over the set of pixels to create a color value who, that you then can valuate the distances.","width":564},{"text":"Wow, that wasn't English.","width":154},{"text":"Alright, any questions about that.","width":146},{"text":"Ok, so pick your favorite one of these and start asking me to put them into the bag.","width":587},{"text":"Pick your favorite one.","width":142},{"text":"Which one you like the best.","width":90},{"text":"I know.","width":60},{"text":"I'll just add one.","width":85},{"text":"Well, how about numbers, real numbers.","width":170},{"text":"Ok, we'll just take the first one.","width":110},{"text":"So I'm willing to, at this point, say that my bag is templatized to contain real numbers.","width":433},{"text":"OK.","width":30},{"text":"Do you even wanna do imaginary numbers.","width":339},{"text":"We could.","width":34},{"text":"OK.","width":42},{"text":"Alright, we'll do real numbers.","width":234},{"text":"Alright, so suggest something that I put in my bag.","width":226},{"text":"Suggest something.","width":81},{"text":"Oh.","width":24},{"text":"Did somebody say four.","width":135},{"text":"Did you say four.","width":223},{"text":"Somebody said four.Well I'll put four in, cuz that's what I was thinking.","width":214},{"text":"I don't know anybody said it actually.","width":110},{"text":"Alright, I'm willing to put four into my bag.","width":151},{"text":"Anybody wanna suggest something else.","width":167},{"text":"Two.","width":27},{"text":"I'll put two into my bag.","width":88},{"text":"Sure.","width":52},{"text":"Alright, anything else.","width":152},{"text":"A thousand.","width":40},{"text":"Sure.","width":73},{"text":"I'm just reminding you we are talking about real numbers here.","width":333},{"text":"Pi, ok.","width":115},{"text":"Pi is real, right.","width":119},{"text":"Ok, anything else.","width":160},{"text":"Good enough.","width":135},{"text":"I'm gonna put negative forty-two, cuz that's fun.","width":262},{"text":"Ok, good.","width":62},{"text":"You are fine.","width":101},{"text":"So it doesn't feel like there's anything I'm not willing to put into the bag, right, and it's true.","width":349},{"text":"Cross the
