[{"text":"Those of you with your hands raised, uhmmmmmm.","width":202},{"text":"I wan't you to very carefully instead of just saying the answer, the next thing I'm going to ask you is: How do you know that's the answer?","width":567},{"text":"So think a little bit about how you would argue that your answer is correct.","width":382},{"text":"For those of you who are waiting for me to respond.","width":255},{"text":"Okay ready?","width":206},{"text":"It is N*(N-1)/2.","width":218},{"text":"Where did that come from?","width":303},{"text":"N time N minus 1 over 2.","width":310},{"text":"Okay.","width":62},{"text":"Alright.","width":65},{"text":"So raise your hand if instead of saying that, you were actually going to say N choose 2.","width":658},{"text":"Were you going to say N choose 2?","width":307},{"text":"Okay good, we're going to talk about all of yours together so remember that its you and who said N time N minus 1 over 2?","width":518},{"text":"Okay good, help me remember that its the two of you guys.","width":193},{"text":"Okay?","width":67},{"text":"And lets see there's one more way of thinking about this.","width":293},{"text":"Yea?","width":5},{"text":"ESP here you don't even have to finish.","width":458},{"text":"Okay?","width":69},{"text":"Yes.","width":37},{"text":"The summation of- oh you wanna finish?","width":184},{"text":"Yea.","width":52},{"text":"Summation K equals 0 to N minus 1 of K.","width":278},{"text":"Very good.","width":22},{"text":"Alright.","width":46},{"text":"So you learned early on.","width":144},{"text":"So you learned early on that all three of these things were equivalent.","width":358},{"text":"But.","width":109},{"text":"In the context of this particular application of these results, there are different ways of looking at the problem that leads to each one of them.","width":801},{"text":"Okay?","width":15},{"text":"How- what justifies this?","width":285},{"text":"We're counting edges.","width":94},{"text":"We're counting edges and I want to know why this is a good answer?","width":326},{"text":"Who said this one to me?","width":75},{"text":"Why is this one a good answer?","width":635},{"text":"Very good!","width":24},{"text":"Excellent!","width":84},{"text":"So what he said was \"Look, every edge has 2 endpoints.","width":303},{"text":"Each of those endpoints has to be a vertex, so the total number of ways of choosing edges is the number of vertices choose 2.","width":896},{"text":"Any question about that?","width":162},{"text":"That's how many edges there are.","width":146},{"text":"Any question about it?","width":66},{"text":"No?","width":66},{"text":"Good?","width":6},{"text":"Okay, uhmmmmmm.","width":31},{"text":"Let's talk about this one next?","width":369},{"text":"How do you justify this one?","width":121},{"text":"Who said this one?","width":96},{"text":"Who said- Oh yea, how do you justify this one?","width":315},{"text":"Oh its the shorthand for this one?","width":112},{"text":"So should we talk about this one first?","width":124},{"text":"How do we justify this one?","width":87},{"text":"Mike?","width":1252},{"text":"Very good.","width":87},{"text":"Very good.","width":27},{"text":"Okay.","width":45},{"text":"So.","width":27},{"text":"Here's how we're gonna argue this.","width":138},{"text":"Okay?","width":39},{"text":"I'm gonna start at a particular vertex and say alright how many new edges can I draw from that vertex.","width":507},{"text":"And if there are N vertices then I can draw and edge to all of the other ones, or N minus 1.","width":462},{"text":"Then, I can go to the next vertex and do the same thing.","width":271},{"text":"How many can I draw?","width":94},{"text":"N minus 2.","width":121},{"text":"Go to the next vertex, do the same thing.","width":202},{"text":"N minus 3.","width":105},{"text":"Okay?","width":22},{"text":"is that clear?","width":76},{"text":"In the end you end up with a summation that looks like this.","width":353},{"text":"Alright.","width":85},{"text":"One last cool thing to discuss.","width":314},{"text":"Okay?","width":70},{"text":"Pretend that I drew this whole graph.","width":374},{"text":"Pretend I drew all the edges here.","width":140},{"text":"I think I probably missed, well, some.","width":172},{"text":"Pretend I drew them all.","width":160},{"text":"And pretend this is a complete graph with N vertices.","width":301},{"text":"Now what I want to do is count edges by counting endpoints.","width":559},{"text":"Okay?","width":85},{"text":"How many endpoints are there here?","width":320},{"text":"N minus 1.","width":136},{"text":"How many endpoints are there here?","width":273},{"text":"N minus 1.","width":66},{"text":"How many endpoints are here?","width":154},{"text":"N minus 1 all the way around right?","width":232},{"text":"How many N minus 1's do I have?","width":243},{"text":"N of them!","width":58},{"text":"That's right.","width":57},{"text":"N times N minus 1.","width":176},{"text":"So whats with the division by two?","width":314}]
