2 to the h plus one. I can do this really fast. 2-h uh. Alright, any questions about it? It's like the easiest time to [gibberish]. Somebody magically gave you the answers. Okay? Alright, but we don't want this thing in terms of h we want it in terms of n. So what we know is that umm that height is big oh of log(n). Or n is greater than or equal to two to the n. I can do this. So h equals. What's the exact expression for h. h is at least [gibberish]. I'm going to do it like this. Ill figure out the inequalities in a minute. So I know s(h) so it is the sum of the pathways is equal to 2 to the h plus one. minus 2 minus h. But I also know that h is at most some constant time log(n) and so this thing is at most 2 to the constant time log(n) plus 1 minus 2 minus constant time for log(n) yeah. Okay which is we do all of this math big oh of n. The only salient piece is this first term. Only salient piece is this first term. Oh the big C matters in this case. I'm going to figure this out. I am. I think I have to do that. Alright. Only one more little thing. So. Here is what I want to do. I made a heap and now I want to use that heap so that the data can be skimmed in a particular order. I started off data in no particular order. And [gibberish] and then I built a heap out of it. Now I want to view this heap to sort of finish the sorting of the the sorting of original data that was in no particular order. How would I do that? How might I do that. How would I sort this thing. What could I do? How do I get this data from that. I mean yes. I think the biggest hint I have is selection sort if you remember correctly remember selection sort? Without a heap how can I create. I can make another array if I want to. How can I make a sorted array if I got a heap?
