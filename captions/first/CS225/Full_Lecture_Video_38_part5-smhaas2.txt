you have all of the, you have all of the notation you need to fill in these blanks. How many edges are there. Yeah? yeah good. I'm going to take his english and put it into symbols. It's the number of vertices in the component minus one. and how did you know that was true?! By the inductive hypothesis. Very good. Any questions about that? Look at this, all the components that we broke this puppy into they are all smaller. How do we know they are smaller? because we removed one of the vertices. right? so they are begging us to have the inductive hypothesis applied. so we did. now all we have to do is add up all the edges in the original graph. ok.. so. hm. So I'm going to add up from k = 0 to d the edges the size of the edge set in component k. you good? That is... We good. seem okay so far. alright so I'm adding up all the edges. so we just said that each one of the components has that many. So this is like the sum from k = 0 to d of the size the v k - 1 and then in the original graph how many edges did we remove? How many edges did we remove from the original graph? d of them. good. kay. alright. now all I have to do is some arithmetic. I wish i had more space. I'm doing it up above. so what is this? k = 0 to d of v k - d + 1 + d. alright i'm going to point to a term you tell me where it came from. where did this term come from right here? right here. Where did that term come from.  Point to it on the screen. Where did it come from? Aha really? all you have to do is point. just point. are you awake? out the door? good. Where did this term come from. It's wrong that's why. How about that is that better? ooooooooo. Alright all I'm going to do is distribute the sum. distribute the summation into the subtraction. okay so the first one is the sum from 0 to d of all the vertices in each of the components minus... how many of these minus terms are there? well there are d + 1 of them. right. then the plus d is all of the edges incident on the original vertex that we removed. happy? smile if you are happy please. alright. I'm going on any way. I don't care. just kidding I do care. alright. What is this? What is a nice expression for this right here? this sum. Sum of all the vertices. It's just the size of the vertex set right? the size of v. So all of the vertices, we just added them all up in each component. and then if you put all these together what do you get? minus one good. and that's it. That's all you got. We are done. QED. Okay. raise your hand if you are still awake. raise your hand if you think that if i moved this slide so that you couldn't see it any more and i collected all your papers if you could reproduce that proof. raise your hand if you could reproduce that proof. Raise your hand if that makes you giggle. The thought of it. Ok. yeah. alright. so I find this proof very interesting because it works so nicely. I have no idea how it feels to have someone else talking about the proof. alright any questions about it? can i elucidate it? yeah?
