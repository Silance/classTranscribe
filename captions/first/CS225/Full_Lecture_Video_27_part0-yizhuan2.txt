classes is at eleven o clock 
alright so this what I'm talking about so raises your hand you would supporting
ok so ah the student section was full
the student section was more full than stadium 
yes! a long ago I was not there cause it was my mother  birthday party 
so you know probably family politics but this is what was like a pregame 
it is a big party so somebody who went somebody raises your hand if you went the ball game?
was it a blast? yea
and we won't talk about the outcome
I will tell you thought I will tell you that my mother birthday party was in Wisconsin 
so I was hearing you know I was hearing the game updates from the wrong side 
the whole time my husband loos at me is like HAHAHA
so you know family family complexities 
ok so let's go to school lets play school 
 ok em you have an exam a week from tomorrow 
em we are going to do it you know all of our intentions is gonna waste here
 em we are going to do a big exam this is known as the tree exam
so all the questions on this  almost all the question on this exam will be related to the trees
in one way or another
though we will also include maybe a little bit more serious stacks and queues
you should notice that level-order traversal is a great way for me to ask you about both queues and about something it related to tree and about MP4
so make sure you see the connections between queues and stacks as well actually and traversal of the trees and MP4 cause there not be sort of very rich set of topics around that we can build questions
now I don't say any knowledge what is exam looks like about 
and I am not even writing the exam
I am just saying if I were you that would be one area of sort of integrated learning you might take it very seriously
and on this end of thing that is the beginning 
stacks and queues are kind of the beginning
we also have not yet tested  you on iterators in any reasonable way
so I would expect multiple choice question or something related to iterations and generic programming in C++
em also let's see
em on this end of thing
all the way through Friday's lecture this week will be on exam 
so we will finish up B-trees on Friday
we are finishing up AVL trees today
we are gonna do B-trees Wednesday and Friday and then there will be this kind of clean
break away from trees
ok let's see we will provide you opportunities for review 
and we usually do MP5 solution party right you know in those few days between MP5 and the exam 
em what else I don't know 
you know you can do your own MP4 solution party if you'd like 
it's not quite complex as MP5 
alright em
I am gonna save playing around with the all node hack 
let's just do it
slide this  and go
here and go  here 
oh yea! it's this
and now I am actually turn on the AVL
ok so last time we've talk about the fundamental algorithms for maintaining the balance of an tree
today we are going to  actually write the code or I will show you the written code for insertion and I believe removal happens in labs 
I believe you will write the code for removal in the lab 
em 
but 
oh 
hey
 ha 
look 
em 
a-o 
ok I can recover
brand this 
oh and look at the sound
ok come on everybody 
everybody is happy
everything is awesome
