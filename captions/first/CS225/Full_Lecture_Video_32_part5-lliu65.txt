It's still big right? Still big, and same here especially if it doesn't exist. Key thing to observe is as alpha goes to 1, functions are nasty. Go to infinity. That means we shouldn't let alpha go to 1. Shouldn't let table fill. Hmmmmm. Alright, finally notice in context of separate chaining. In these cases, alpha is an element of 0 to 1. Here, alpha can be larger than 1. Because its open hashing, can hang many things. As alpha increases, those running times increase. This is what they look like. There is inflection point beyond here. We're going to be looking for a long time for these clusters that exist since they're large in case of linear probing. Beyond small alpha, number of probes is quite large. I want you to make a vertical line that reflects number of probes willing to accept. Draw a line corresponding to number of probes. Then, when I do this, if my alpha is below .75 Ive got it. This suggests if table is less than 75% full, then lookup is quick.
