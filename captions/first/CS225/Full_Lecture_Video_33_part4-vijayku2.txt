You guy are like on it today. Yes? Ah it's a complete binary tree. Good observation, so I'm going to write that down. It's a complete binary tree ok? Anything else? Yes? It's what? Ordered in its levels but it isn't. This is a complete tree where each parent's key is less than its two children's keys. That's new, we haven't seen this before. These two things together characterize this structure completely. Typically we will take an implication of the second. The implication is that every path from the root to a leaf is monotonically increasing. The implication of the second one that we're going to use is every path from root to leaf is increasing. Ok, this structure that you've now characterized has got a special name, its called a heap. It's actually a binary min heap. But we just very quickly refer to it as a heap. So I want to do a quick recursive definition. The quick recursive definition is a binary min heap is a complete tree with the following characteristics:
1. T = empty tree is a binary min heap
2. if T = a root together with a left subtree and a right subtree, then the key of the root (the key of r) is less than the key of TL's root and TR's root (if they exist) and furthermore, TL and TR are heaps.
