so he is asking about how many helper functions do you need for this
one for height one for balance factor and four for the rotation cases
i need those constructors
this is what we are good at this point
this is what is going to get you money
alright avl tree removal
what happens if i remove 9
ohhhhhhhhhhh
oh yeah okay
first is this tree imbalanced is this tree balanced?
nothing out of balnce i dont think
you can eyeball it here
what happens if i remove 9
its even beter
i got a better one
what happens if i remove 10 haha
alright
alright so lets trace this a second
this is just an example
i am going to remove 9
10 is structurally the same
so we remove 9 and we have every reason to belive that the process of removal
mimics that of insert
we can test after we change the structure of the tree if a rotation is necessary
binary search tree removal invokes an inorder predesscor
which may invoke further cutting of the tree
but also in inorder predeccesor
but we are not going to do those details here
for now we are just going to remove 9
what kind of rotation fixes this tree?
some kindof left rotation
correct?
which kind of left roatation?
double rotation because at that point the balance factor here would be two
the factor here would be -1
so it is a left right rotation that is neccessary
here you can use the same balcnce factor function
so in the end after we do this im going to put this in red
because you will be able to see what happens
in the end im going to have 11 here 10 tere and 12 here still
kay
and this will be gone because the rotation will result in this
we will complete call and come here and what happens?
uhhhhhhhhh
now it is out of balnce
you see that
because it is long on this side we have shortened one that was barely long enough
so that creates another imbalance so what rotation fixes this?
a right rotation
right
yes
very very good
and what do you think a right or double or single
single
i think either works in this case
but we might as well go single
so it will result in a righ roation about 8
now think about it
this tree routed at 8 mihtbarely have been long enough
and we shortened it
it might be a subtree
this tree that i have painted here might be a subtree
in some larger structure
and it might have barelyl been tall enough and we just shorted it
actually fixing things at 8 may need a rotation farther up the structure
doing a removal you may have to do rotations all the way up the tree
you see how that is possible?
lets move on
we will see how far we get
so
