good right? two is bigger than the square root of two. so it holds. N(1) i should be doing it like this. N(0) equals one. the expression gives 2^0/2 N(0) >= 2^0/2. Okay. What if age is greater than one? then by an inductive hypothesis that says I'm going to write this down explicitly, but there's not a lot of thought behind it. Im gonna write it down in a robotic way. it simply says for any value less than 8 an AVL tree of height j has at least 2^j/2 nodes. So it's a restatement of the theorem. It's a restatement of theorem but um it's this less than or equal to here that's important. This says the result holds for smaller trees. the result holds for smaller trees. so now and since we do know we've already argued that N(h) is at least 2*N(h-2), what do we know about this? yeah look is h-2 smaller than h? yeah? in this algebra it is. so we can apply the inductive hypothesis yes. it's a valid j. it's a valid j. So, we can replace it because this is the lowest value for an AVL tree of height h-2. N is that value. so, we know that this is at least 2*2^(h-2/2). oh boy I hope this arithmetic works. we know that N(h) is at least did you do it? did you do the arithmetic. factor of 2 here. -2/2 is 1 so those cancel and we end up with 2^h/2. Yay. and that was for h>=0. okay fine good what's the punch line. That doesn't seem very compelling. Now we turn it around so we have this result that says N the true number of nodes is at least 2^(h/2) when h >=0. that's our result but now all we have to do is invert it right? and so let's see. I better takes logs of both sides. Log(N) is at least h/2. oh and I don't even have to rewrite this. Multiply both sides by 2 and look what we have we have h <= a constant*log(N). Oh cool. and what is this function what is this function when h = 0? I'm sorry what is this when h =0 it's N >=1. This to me, looks a whole lot like here's f here's c here's g here's k looks a lot like the definition of Big-O. So we can conclude that for AVL trees worst case the height = O(logn). Yippee. That makes us happy. any question about it?
