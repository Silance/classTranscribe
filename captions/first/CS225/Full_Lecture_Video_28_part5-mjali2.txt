Good, right? Two is bigger than the square root of two. So it holds.  N of 1, I should be doing it like this. N of 0 equals 1; the expression gives 2^0 root 2, N of 0 is greater than or equal to 2^0 root 2. Okay. What if h is greater than 1? Then, by an inductive hypotheis that says I'm going to write this down explicitly, but there's not a lot of thought behind. I'm gonna write it down in a sort of automatonic, a robotic way. It simply says, for any value less than h, an AVL tree of height j has at least 2^(j/2) nodes. So it's a restatement of the theorem, but it's this less than or equal to here that's important. This says the result holds for smaller trees. Alright so now and since we do know we've already argued that N(h) is at least 2 * N(h-2), what do we know about this? Now look, is h-2 smaller than h? Yeah? In this algebra it is. So we can apply the inductive hypothesis, yes! It's a valid j. So we can replace it because this is the lowest value for an AVL of height h-2, n is that value. So we know that this is at least 2*(2^((h-2)/2))). Oh boy I hope this arithmetic works. We know that N(h) is at least...did you do it? Did you do the arithmetic? Factor of 2 here, -2/2 is 1 so those cancel and we end up with 2^(h/2). Yay! And that was for h >= 0. Okay, fine, good, what's the punch line? That doesn't seem very compelling. Now we turn it around. So we had this result that says n, the true number of nodes is at least 2^(h/2), when h >= 0. That's our result. But now all we have to do is invert it, right? And so let's see, I better take logs of both sides. Log of n is at least h/2, oh and I don't even have to rewrite this. Multiply both sides by 2 and look what we have. We have h <= a constant * log(n). Cool! And what is this function when h is equal to 0? I'm sorry what is this when h is equal to zero? It's n >= 1. This to me looks a whole lot like, here's f, here's c, here's g, here's k, looks a lot like the definition of big O. So we can conclude that for AVL trees, worst case, the height is bigger O(log n). Yippee! That makes us happy. Okay any question about it?
