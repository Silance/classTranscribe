No, a max degree is the number of children you have.
Degree is the number of edges coming out. okay?
Four is the number of keys that you have, because it's one less than the number of nodes coming out. So you can have five coming out. Let's fill one up and you'll see it. Well, oh this is so much fun. We need to insert a few values. I think it would be good if we insert a whole bunch of values over here for now. Just cause I want you to see it again, and then I actually want you to see what happens when we throw up. I love saying that. Throw up to the root when there's no room. Alright, I'm going to insert [gibberish]. Maybe shrink it just a little. Oh, there. Perfect. Insert thirty, insert i don't know, forty. Make sure that you are following where all these go, okay? Follow along. You all have the speculation. Insert forty. Oh, what happened? It threw up, that's right. Threw one up. Alright, fine. Now notice the degree of the root is four. Right? The degree of the root is four. It has four edges coming out of it and it has three things in it. So as I said, there is a child node between every pair of keys and one at each end. Notice that if I hide all this. If I hide this center thing, you pretty much have a binary search tree right? Or if I hide, you know if you have one node and two things on the side [gibberish] right? It just behaves differently. Alright, I think I want to do something like insert five, seven. Now what? Eight, okay, eight. Oh. Okay, got it? We gotta do this one more time right? We must. It's awesome. Alright, I think that middle child is feeling a little neglected. So, let's insert sixteen. That's a joke. Little child neglected, you know? I hate it when you miss my jokes. Especially when they're bad. Okay ready? I'm entering in twenty. Alright. Dun dun dun. Are you ready? Are you ready? Yes? Okay. I wish I could slow it down. Alright, I'm putting in twenty six. Alright. Okay. Insert twenty six. Oh. It threw up twice. Stupid, stupid. Okay, got it? Yes? This is a good question. It makes you giggle every time huh? Okay. Alright, so the question is, so I chose a maximum degree which was odd. In fact, when we talk about B-trees, it's called the order of the B-trees. The order of this B-tree is five. The question is, how do we deal with even orders. Would you like to speculate any ideas? This is a design moment. How can we deal with even degrees, or even orders? What do you think? Do you want to answer your own question with a guess?
