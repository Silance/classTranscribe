Good,very good! I just counted n points right? and every edge has two end points. So this is the degree of each vertex that is one of those vocabularies words times the number of vertexes that get you all end points divided by 2. because we are counting edges not end points. Is it clear? Now I love this there are these 3 completely different ways of looking at the same problem. That's cool. Any question about it? OK one more little thing that we are gonna need for many algorithms that we do. They will go cross a vertex and do something on every edge on the vertex. So, our algorithms will iterate over all the vertexes. So many of our algorithms will do something over each vertex for each incident edge on the vertex. Now I wanna know an exact expression for what it must be. And I do not mean a upper bond on it, I mean tell me as accurately as you can, what you get if you add up all degrees of all the vertexes? Very similar to something you have already thought about today. Yeah, twice number of edges, very good! no matter what, if you add up all the degrees of all the vertexes, you end up with all the end points which has to be twice the number of edges. Now why it is so important?  why don't we always just use this? The answer is because not all graphs have all their edges. somethings , we can be a little bit more specific with our algorithms and base them on the running time, the number of edges. Any questions?  I think that I promise you about this prove. So let's go do that. Here is the set up. You notice that the theorem itself has a little bit different of a statement. What minimally connected graph means is if you took out an edge, the graph would fall apart. so, minimally connected means removing an edge makes the graph disconnected. another way saying is it is connected basically graph. Minimal means there are no extra edges. So it is another way saying it is a tree.
