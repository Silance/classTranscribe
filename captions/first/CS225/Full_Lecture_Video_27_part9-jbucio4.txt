Yeah, of the function f(n) is Big O of g(n) if and only if ... ok good... is a constant C so that ... good ... very good ok ... so I'm gonna take that force of efficiently large n and turn into some another extension variable k and making n is greater than k. Ok. Alright , whoa. What the heck?! That was impressive. If this were friendly environment I might give you a hand. That was really good. Ok there is constant c in K so that the function is less than some factor of this other function when n is big enough. Ok. This function that I am gonna arguing about is we think log logarithmic Ok .. of f(n). We think is logarithmic but we don't know for sure.
