not going to do this
slow
ssds are about 300 MB per sec
both are slow compared to the number of instructions you can do
its weird i can do somethings in the front of the room but not basic artithmetic
4+8 is i dont know
lets think about an avl tree that is considered to be lots of data
consider the us driving records
how many records do you think there are
make a guess
this is a question google will ask you
how many drivers in the us 300 million is an upper bound
how many people there are
160 million current us driving records
increasing
20 years only half adults drove
the cool thing is in 20 years it will go back down
we didnt let our teenager get a driving licence because google cars are going to be real
he will ride in an autonomous vehicle
tesla will beat him
how much data 
how much per record
300 million 3 megs each so uhh
you have a picture there
i dont know
what is that
its only a gig
thats not a lot
okay heres the point
i am sweating so badly
this is like 
this is too deep
its about 28 tall
i did this once
i didnt prepare today
i didnt look at notes
i  cant remember
lets say the avl tree is 30 deep 
what that means is you may have to look for 
you may have to do 30 comparisons down an avl tree to get to your data
thats all fine if your avl tree is sitting in memory because you can acess that super fast 
30 comparison who cares
heres what is really happening a cartoon version of whats  really happening
suppose this is the avl tree of us driving record and suppose it doesnt fit in ram
you do a find i want to find number 66 heres what happens
i need some driving record 
my disk is way out there
you have to go all the way out
mr or ms avl tree give me a key
bring it all the way back
walk slower
bring all the way back 68 bigger or smaller than 66 that happens supper fast
i need the other part of the tree
