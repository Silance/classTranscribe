Those of you with your hands raised, uhmmmmmm. I wan't you to very carefully instead of just saying the answer, the next thing I'm going to ask you is: How do you know that's the answer? So think a little bit about how you would argue that your answer is correct. For those of you who are waiting for me to respond. Okay ready? It is N*(N-1)/2. Where did that come from? N time N minus 1 over 2. Okay. Alright. So raise your hand if instead of saying that, you were actually going to say N choose 2. Were you going to say N choose 2? Okay good, we're going to talk about all of yours together so remember that its you and who said N time N minus 1 over 2? Okay good, help me remember that its the two of you guys. Okay? And lets see there's one more way of thinking about this. Yea? ESP here you don't even have to finish. Okay? Yes. The summation of- oh you wanna finish? Yea. Summation K equals 0 to N minus 1 of K. Very good. Alright. So you learned early on. So you learned early on that all three of these things were equivalent. But. In the context of this particular application of these results, there are different ways of looking at the problem that leads to each one of them. Okay? How- what justifies this? We're counting edges. We're counting edges and I want to know why this is a good answer? Who said this one to me? Why is this one a good answer? Very good! Excellent! So what he said was "Look, every edge has 2 endpoints. Each of those endpoints has to be a vertex, so the total number of ways of choosing edges is the number of vertices choose 2. Any question about that? That's how many edges there are. Any question about it? No? Good? Okay, uhmmmmmm. Let's talk about this one next? How do you justify this one? Who said this one? Who said- Oh yea, how do you justify this one? Oh its the shorthand for this one? So should we talk about this one first? How do we justify this one? Mike? Very good. Very good. Okay. So. Here's how we're gonna argue this. Okay? I'm gonna start at a particular vertex and say alright how many new edges can I draw from that vertex. And if there are N vertices then I can draw and edge to all of the other ones, or N minus 1. Then, I can go to the next vertex and do the same thing. How many can I draw? N minus 2. Go to the next vertex, do the same thing. N minus 3. Okay? is that clear? In the end you end up with a summation that looks like this. Alright. One last cool thing to discuss. Okay? Pretend that I drew this whole graph. Pretend I drew all the edges here. I think I probably missed, well, some. Pretend I drew them all. And pretend this is a complete graph with N vertices. Now what I want to do is count edges by counting endpoints. Okay? How many endpoints are there here? N minus 1. How many endpoints are there here? N minus 1. How many endpoints are here? N minus 1 all the way around right? How many N minus 1's do I have? N of them! That's right. N times N minus 1. So whats with the division by two?
