All right, fine. What is the running time of these functions? Oh, they are O(n) but you can say something tighter. You can say something faster. So remember big O of somethting is less than and equal to, and, so, yes. You can say, there is big O of 2 to n too. The question, what's the very least thing you can say, what's the very tightest thing you can say. log n is correct.  That's right, so we showed, we argued that are these things running time log n, because the height of tree is log n. And the navigation for the code is the height of tree. OK, fine. This structure can be built in time, how long does it to take to build a heap out of previously unordered data. Did you remember? this was all of last time's class, pretty much. A huge portion of last time's class meeting. Yes, linear time. So we can build a heap really really quickly. Big O of n is the next blink. and that helps us do the first step in doing a sort, a in place sort called heap sort. And the running time of this in place heap sort is nlogn. that's right, OK. that's the summary of last time. Anybody wanna close the loop for me on why the picture reminds us of heap? yeah, if you build a human pyramid, you put the lightest person on top, that's right. And they give removed and then you have somebody climbed up to be, wait, no, not that, OK, let me see how we are doing here, oh my god, it gonna be a long day. OK, I will actually flipping my page if I were on if I actually had my laptop I would amendment my slide. So you gonna move to the slide that said remembering cs173. And the verbiage said, let R be an equivalence relation. Raise your hand if you are stunned by my term just a little bit. And several students in this room, OK I saw a couple of hands over there. OK, we have equivalence relation on us, OK, I am not a student, so on you, there is an equivalence relation where any pairs of you are related to one and another if you have the favorite among this set. Now, before we actually the equivalence relation itself. I want you to help me figure out what *** in *** in that set. What *** in *** in that set. So the set contains A, FB, CC, PMC. What's the last one?And it depends what are those are, right? It might be an obvious one if you can figure out what are those others are. FB is not facebook, though it might be I guess, oh that's not facebook. It's not football leader. First Blood, did you say first blood? That's we would say when you guys take an exams, when somebody finish the exam and leave the room we call it First Blood. Is it cruel? I don't know. that's funny. It played a little insight. What else can we say. What is CC, not current copy. What is CC, name something with CC. Close captions, not current copy, not close captions, not nearly so boring, these are fun, come on, that's a big hint. What did you say? ** **, so you think you are ** **, no. That would be good to know, next you all do that. Where are they.
