and then how many edges does it have? well it's just another way of saying n-1, cuz the size of v is n. Alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna consider a random, arbitrary minimally connected graph. I've drawn a picture of one here, we're going to let v and e denote the vertex and edge sets. Now there's a lemma that we're going to need, that is every connected subgraph - it's like subsets of these with some constrains of them - you should look up them to be concrete - so if you take a connected subgraph and you remove an edge, they'll fall apart. there's an easy way to prove this: if the subgraph is not minimally connected, you can remove an edge and it wouldn't fall apart. but then it would be true of the super graph too - the larger graph too. and we already know that the large graph is minimally connected, so the prove is sort of unsatisfying, it's an easy proof by contradiction. okay finally we have our inductive hypothesis, notice here all I've done is I restated the theorem for graphs with fewer vertices. So it just says for any j less than the size of vertex z, any minimally connected graph containing that lesser number of vertices has j-1 edges. That's the inductive hypothesis, I'm gonna ask you where we're gonna apply it. So base case, a minimally connected graph of 1 vertex have no edges. Is that true? Yes. we're going to take a large graph and break it apart. we're going to pull out any one of the vertices and its incident edges. remove its incident edges, partitioning the graph into - how many components do we end up in the graph? d+1. where c0 is going to be the vertex we remove. choose any vertex w and the edge set is empty. all the other components are going to look like this. How many edges do we have in the whole thing? all of we gonna do is count up edges. How many edges (what's the size of the edge set) are there in component k (any one of the component)? you know how many there are.
