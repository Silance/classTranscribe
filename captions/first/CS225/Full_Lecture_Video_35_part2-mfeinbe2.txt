I'll give you a hint, the A used to be a B.  But I changed it to A for this year.  And we're at 83%. Yeah? What? Oh. Geez. huh.  Yeah. It's rather embarrasing actually. Okay. What are these things? We've got to get going. What's CC? You can get this! Creep what? Creepy Commune? No! No. Alright. fine. How about PMT? How about just MC? You know what? This tells me you work too hard! Is that a clue? It's a clue! Anyone have something for me? Any Guesses? Master of Ceremonies? No, these are fun! They're not beers! Darn! Next year! No, cuz that's just like an old fart just trying to be cool. Like if I use a lot of beers in here, I'm just trying to be cool.  So no, this is way more fun than that! Ain't got nothing? I'm not going to tell you. I'm just not. Just choose one that might be your. Just choose one that you think might be your favorite. Okay now, I want to talk to you if you decide arbitrarily and I'm not telling you what you have chosen here. If you think your favorite might be denoted by A, okay? Okay, so I have the two of you. Since you both chose A, you are related to one another under this equivalence relation.  Okay, now that means you are part of the same equivalence class.  So everyone who chose A, raise your hands please. Everybody who chooses A. Just the two of you? I don't even believe it. Okay its your grade for this class. How about that? There you go!  We're at 97%! Thank god!  Yeah, about. Alright. Okay, so they're related to one another.  Now, are you related to anybody else under this equivalence relation? Oh, anyone else who has a different favorite. No! The answer is no! So, nobody is related to anybody else who has a different favorite among the elements of this set.  It's killing me isn't.  I'm not telling you! I'm not!I need to be able to write.  I don't know.  My whole machine is dead!  It's dead! Oh. Yeah but. We've updated your PC! All your files are exactly where you left them!
