Oh no! It really wants me to use their interface. Oh no! No! Oh no! Oh no! Alright. Alright, here's a random one. I'm on a random one. Sorry guys, I think I've seen this one before. Alright. Alright. So...need you to start telling me numbers, insert. Can you read that? Okay. Yes you can. This is not a good applet. Sigh. Sorry but you need this. Okay! So I'm building up a B-Tree and you notice right now that I'm basically just inserting things into the root. It's fundamentally implemented dictionary just like the AVL tree did, it's an alternative to the AVL tree. You can't see that at all. Oh my god, it's 25 and 28, okay? So maybe draw this down. They're both in the same box. Okay? I'm gonna put in 35, so I put in 35. Where did it go? Where do you think it went? So the right of 25 and 38, and then I'm gonna put in 14. Where do you think it's gonna go? To the left, still in the root node. Good. Okay! Now, I have chosen a max degree of 4. That's one of the parameters to this applet. You should be sitting there thinking what the heck is all that about? A max degree of 5! Okay? What it means is that a node can have 5 children and it has a child between every piece of data and at each end. Okay? Yes, it has a child between every key and at each end. So we now have the maximum potential degree, because we have 4 pieces of data and you know, there's no room for any more in that node. So, let me add another one and see what happens. I'm adding 52. I don't remember what our other pieces of data were. Oh! Oh! I know you cant see it, you saw what happened structurally. You want to speculate on what happened? What happened to change the shape in that way. We have 5 pieces of data, they were in order, they were ordered pieces of data, and now the structure looks like that. What happened? No speculation at all? No way?
