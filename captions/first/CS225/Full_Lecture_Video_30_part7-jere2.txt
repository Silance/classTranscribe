And you can change this, theres lots of em, k? Alright so its not one to one. Umm and its not onto, meaning that the table is not used efficiently. 

So this is petals around the rose.

You can go show this to your roommate. 

Any questions about it? You need 5 dice though. Your life will not be complete unless you have a store of dice. You need a box into which you're gonna keep dice because you're gonna need them for your life. For your life You need a laptop and a bunch of dice. I don't know what else, some flip flops.

Is it a good function? Any questions about this?

Alright, I have a question for u. How big is the keyspace of rolling 5 dice?

Its biggggg!! Keyspace is huugeee. If you are going to figure this out combinatorially the counting lesson you want to look up is I believe stars and bars if you're going to figure this out. Displacement or stars and bars, and I'm actually going to start next time with that because its fun. We're going to figure out how big is the keyspace.

Any questions about this? Umm sure.

1 1 1 1 1 5 is the same as 1 1 1 1 1 5, where i switched the first 2 dice. I hate this day! Okay we're going to count it. We either do it now or next time.

Alright I have room, okay, keyspace. 

Okay, so here's how we're going to do this. We're going to transform a roll of 5 dice into a different model that is umm is communicative in a way that is easy to count. We're going to take 3. What's the next one? 6, okay! What's the next one? Okay 1! And the next one? AHhahahaha thats six.

Yeah yeah you could do that.
