oh no, it really wants me to use their interface, oh no. oh no.oh no. oh no. alright, alright where's a random one. I want a random one.sorry guys, i think i've seen this one before, alright. so, i need you to start telling me numbers, insert, can you read that? okay, yes you can. this is not a good applet, i'm so sorry but you need this. okay, so i'm building  up a btree and you notice right now that i'm basically just inserting things into the root, it fundamentally implements a dictionary just like the AVL tree did, it's an alternative to the AVL tree, you can't see that at all, oh my gosh it's twenty five and twenty eight, they're both in the same box. Okay. um. I'm going to put in thirty five so i put in thirty five where did it go, where do you think it went, to the right of twenty five and thirty eight okay, and i'm going to put in fourteen, where do you think it's going to go? to the left, still in the root node good okay now I have chosen a max degree of four okay that's one of the parameters to this applet you should be sitting there thinking what the heck is that all about, a max degree of five okay? what it means is that a node can have five children and it has a child between every piece of data and at each end, okay? yes so it has a child between every key and at each end so we now have the maximum potential degree because we have four piece of data and you know there's no room for any more in that node, okay so let me add another one and see what happens. i'm adding fifty two i don't remember what our other pieces of data was. oh! oh. i know you can't see it but you saw what happened structurally, you want to speculate on what happened? what happened to change the shape in that way we have five pieces of data they were in order they were ordered pieces of data and now the structure look's like that, what happened? no speculation at all? no way?
