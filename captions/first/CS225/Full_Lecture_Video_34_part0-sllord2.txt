So, give me a one word description of that thing.  It's a heap, that's right.  A two-word description of the abstract data type we're considering using a heap for.  A priority queue, very good.  So, this structure right here is our latest, greatest attempt at a clever implementation for a priority queue.  OKay?  What implementations did we try before?  What are we trying to improve over?  Do you remember from last time?  We first implemented a priority queue with...?  A bag.  Yeah, the bag didn't work out so well.  What was the implementation?  A linked list, sorted or unsorted?  Either, we tried both, the other linear structure we tried as an array, sorted and unsorted and those all, you know they had things we liked about them, they also had things we didn't like about them. Alright, so that's all of last lecture in a nutshell, right there. Alright, so this thing is a heap, how do we implement it?  What's the implementation of a heap?  What structures did we use to implement a heap?  An array.  So that's a piece that at first glance is a little counter-intuitive.  Because this thing is a binary tree, right?  And all the binary trees we've talked about so far have had tree node pointers and have been recursively traversed, etc., and this one is a little bit different.  What characteristic of a heap allows an array-based implementation?
