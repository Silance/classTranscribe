A tree that look like this, now when I look at that, It is a little hard to distinguish the fact that there has been some sort of, there is structure to the number themselves, right? This is a, I guess, an increasing sequence. But it requires very particular decreasing sequence going the other way. So it is easy to say, you, do not give me data in sorted order. It is a little harder to say, make sure not to give me data that looks like this. Because I don't even know necessary how to describe that. And yes, it made what looks like bad tree, right? Like this linked-list kind of tree. Now I have a question for you. This is a harder puzzle yet I want to know how many bad item tree are there. We agree this is a bad tree because it is no better than linked list.  I want to know if I have N pieces of data, how many trees are there are there that look like this? My hint is to draw a few of other bad trees. And may you  would just start counting them. Think about the combinatorial of the picture. One, six, two, five, three, four. Make sense? You insert one, that becomes the root, you insert six, goes to the right. Insert two, goes left. Then, you insert five, greater than 1, less than 6, greater than 2. It would probably help if I draw like this. I should be more careful. Anybody have the ideas for how many bad items three there are? I got N pieces of data. I don't really care what they are. There are number one through N. I want to know how many long string tree there are.  Where do you come up with that? It is correct. I wrote it down. Where does that comes from? Actually, might be 2 times N minus one. Where does that come from?
