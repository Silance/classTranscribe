Yershova: Hello. Welcome to CS 225. My name is Anna Yershova. I'm gonna be teaching this class, and I'd like to start with some introduction for our staff. You can find all of us on our web page, which is our course web page, and under the directory for staff you'll see all of our pictures, and you can get contact information as well. So, I have been teaching in CS department since 2010, and I took a short break for two years to California to work as a research scientist at Oculus VR, and then I don't know what it was...about Illinois. The cornfield, probably...I didn't know. And all the lovely weather. But I came back, and I'm here teaching. So I teach CS 225 every spring and virtual reality class every fall. But, there're so many of you, this is just one third of the class, there's two third in ECE building, so I'm not gonna do alone, we have a fantastic staff to help us managing this class. So, I wanna start with Cinda. I wanna introduce Cinda to you. She's the star instructor in our department, and she'll be co-lecturer for our class.
Heeren: Hi, I'm Cinda. I have been teaching here for a decade, CS 225 not quite that long, but longer than you need me to report, and...let's see what else do they wanna know...Oh, I was a graduate student here. Somebody asks me recently what my favorite course was at University at Illinois and my major reaction of course is... (CS 225) Right, right? Except no, cuz I forgot I was a student here too, so actually the time it was CS 350 which was automata for graduate students. So, I also like the algorithms class a lot which is now CS 374, so... you know... this is my favorite class! Forgot! And then of course going along with that is a warning: if you move here, it's very easy to just sort of get swallowed by this place. So, yea, get out while you can when you have the chance, but then again life is good here so I don't know.
