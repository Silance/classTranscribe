What would be the output? 200? Fine, now how would you control for that? So I am the manager I can set up function signature here. This part of the function is called function signature so exactly what is the name of the function, what's the output and what's the input. So I can set it up and hand off the rest to the implementor but maybe i can control the way the function should work. The function signature, do you know what that is? Out of something you might have seen in the lab already. const right? If I  say const here, that is an indication that this function must promise not to change any of the private variables. Okay? So if I write the function declaration with const there, then whatever Im inputting into the function declaration should follow the same function signature. Otherwise, it will not compile. The compiler will be confused. The implementation of the function does not correspond to any of the functions I declared. Okay? because this one may change the private variable but in declaration it promised not to. Sorry, sorry, So the class variable cannot be changed, I am sorry. All of the variables. It means that it will not change the classes so it will stay the same. Okay the question is will it compile this way? No? Am I out of time? Okay, I am out of time, so the answer is they have to match and they will not compile so this function will not be able to change the radius and I can control for malicious or inconfident behavior, okay? So we will start with that next time.
