and the syntax is very simple, i mean it's very similar to each other. Okay, so my class wasn't anything interesting. So if i had a bunch of objects, i still have three minutes i think, if i had a bunch of variables of type sphere, and these would be my spheres, and i would declare them using my user defined types, or my class that i just wrote. all of the spheres would look indistinguishable, they would look like clones of each other, even though to us they look different because they have some attributes that we didn't include in our class definition. so i have a question for you: what kind of variables would be interesting to define in the body of our class here to distinguish the spheres? yeah? radius. radius would distinguish these right? so these spheres i made with same radius so they would look like twins, still. so they would be instances equal instances of the same class, and this would look different, right? so radius is good, what else? color. yeah color would break them into this equivalent groups, but all blue would be indistinguishable, so we would like to have maybe location to break them down, right? ok, now you are free to go, i just want to finish this. ok, i will see you friday.
