Okay, let's start. You can grab some. Okay, so let's start, we're almost done here. Some announcements. I expect that your hard copy of homework is in one of these envelopes. And if not, then just hurry up and submit it under the door of my office because um... But there is a little bit of playing with fire because once I give them away to graders then that's it. So I really hope that they're all here. If you're not registered, I sure hope you put your UIN, otherwise you will not get a link from us for overriding. And there's a big, big chance we'll be able to get all of you because it's a small size of unregistered students. Smaller than one-hundred, which we'll be able to accommodate, so that's really good news for all of you who are not registered yet. Now, because we'll have so many students coming in who were not registered yet, we didn't want to give them an extension for MP1. And it's our tradition, even though it's not written policy, that at this day, we usually announce that, "Hey, MP1 deadline is extended." Okay, we have done that for years. So here we go, MP1 deadline is extended for all of you. For those of you who have submitted it and have a great score, that's fine. For those of you who submitted it and are not happy with your score, there is a chance for you for a regrade. We'll run the regrade on the second of February. But, here's the catch. There's also MP2 out. So, second machine set, problem set is out. And its deadline, its main deadline to get full score for it, which counts towards two percent of the final total grade, the MP2 full deadline is ninth of February. However, if you work fast and complete half of it, and it's all offline in the specs for it. If you complete the first part of MP2, we call it extra credit. You get an additional one percent. So the total score you can get for MP2 is three percent of the total final score.
