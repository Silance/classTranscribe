And the syntax is very simple -- er, I mean very similar to each other. Okay, so my class wasn't anything interesting, so if I had a bunch of objects...I still have three minutes I think...if I had a bunch of variables of type sphere, and these would be my spheres, and I would declare them using my user defined type, or my class that I just wrote, all of these spheres would look indistinguishable. They would look like clones of each other even though to us they look different because they have some attributes that we didn't include in our class definition. So I have a question for you: what kind of variables would be interesting to define in the body of our class here to distinguish these spheres? Yeah? Radius. Radius would distinguish these, right? So these spheres are made of the same radius so they would look like twins still so they would be instances -- equal instances of the same class, and um, and these would look different. Right? So radius is good. What else? Color. Yeah, color would break them into these equivalent groups but all blue would be indistinguishable so we would like to have maybe location to break them down, right? Okay. Now you're free to go, I just wanted to finish this. Okay, I'll see you next Friday.
