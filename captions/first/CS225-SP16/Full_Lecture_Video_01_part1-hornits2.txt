Should we introduce each other? I want to introduce the staff. As you see there's so many of us we need to stay organized. Terry is in charge of logistics. Hi my name is Terry. I am an english major. I do a whole bunch of different things like conflict requests. That's my job. Now we have also a lot of undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants that will help you with a lot of questions about your assignments. They are your lifelines you will get to know some of them very very close.  I'm Mike i'm a sophomore and this is my second semester on staff and something fun about me is i'm very unpopular on reddit. Hi my name is Milan, this is my fourth semester on course staff I used to have access to way too many rooms in the building as a non-major. Hi my name is Kevin I am a junior in CS this is my third semester on course staff. Something cool about me last semester I spent studying in Japan. I didn't take any computer science courses in Japan. Something cool about me is I travel a lot. I've been to twenty-four countries. What year are you? Sophomore. Okay and what's your major? I heard many cold things in the first lecture in ECE. So, our staff and our many more that you can see on the website. This is just a small portion we have like twenty undergraduate and graduate TAs total. Thank you very much guys. Thank you. And I have introduced us now I want to talk a little bit about the class what kind of things you should expect from the class and what you'll learn from the class. I'm gonna start with two metaphors. Imagine yourself in a very big lecture hall. And imagine how you don't what Cinda looks like yet.
