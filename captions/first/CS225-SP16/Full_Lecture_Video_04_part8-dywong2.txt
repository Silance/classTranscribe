You allocate memory, it goes into heap because it is not as high maintenance. Instead of malloc, we use new and delete replaces free. syntax is int * a where a is is an integer pointer. Pointers point to an address but when initialized they are not useful. Setting it to null is address 0 in assembly and points to nothing. To get value of int at that location you derefrence it with *. This gives you the value at that address.
