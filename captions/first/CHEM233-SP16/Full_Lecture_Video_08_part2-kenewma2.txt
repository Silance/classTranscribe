The payoff here is that because infrared spectroscopy allows us to see what kinds of covalent bonds are present in a molecule, it allows us to determine what kinds of functional groups are in present in the molecule. For example, if you look at this table, if my infrared spectrum has an absorbance at 2200 wave numbers  that means I know I have the CC triple bond in my molecule, I have an alkyne. We will talk more about common absorbances and how we can use them in structure determination in the next webcast. But for now we have reached the end of this webcast. To recap, infrared spectroscopy allows us to identify the function groups present in a compound. The reason we can use infrared spectroscopy to do this is because each type of covalent bond in a molecule absorbs a particular wave number of light. And we can see that wave number by what is absorbed in an infrared spectra. The presence of absence of an absorbance in an infrared spectrum can confirm or disprove the presence of a functional group. Of course, there are exceptions and we discuss them in the next webcast. But for now, if an infrared spectrum contains an absorbance for a particular bond, that means the molecule has that type of bond. If an infrared spectrum does not contain an absorbance for a particular type of bond, that means the molecule does not contain that type of bond.
