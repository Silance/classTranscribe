Now lets compare the aldehyde to an ester. We again see two stretches in the carbonyl region that are very similar. You will not be able to tell which of these is the aldehyde or which of these is the ester based solely on the carbonyl stretch. Now lets compare the ester to the acid. As you can see, the acid has two bonds that contain oxygen, a carbonyl and the OH. As you can see, both the ester and the acid have a carbonyl stretch because they both contain carbonyls. However, only the carboxylic acid contains an OH. Which is why only the IR spectrum corresponding to the acid contains this broad OH stretch. This is the end of the example IR spectra for this webcast. These are good examples to use to show you how the presence or absence of a functional group in a molecule can greatly effect what you see in an IR spectrum. The ability to determine what stretches are or are not present will be crucial to your success in interpreting IR spectra.
