And if we count them, we see that we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve hydrogens on this molecule.  Now let's look at the structure in the bottom left.  I see four carbons, and I see eight hydrogens.  If you only counted six hydrogen atoms, don't forget to include the hydrogen atoms attached to the heteroatoms.  Those are also present and they are important to count.  If we go to the structure in the bottom right, I see six carbon atoms and fifteen hydrogen atoms.  If your numbers don't match mine, go ahead and draw in the implicit hydrogens and count again.  Hopefully, this section has been good practice for you in learning how to interpret line structures.  That brings us to the end of this webcast.  To recap: line structures are an efficient way to draw organic molecules.  As most atoms in organic molecules are second row elements, most atoms obey the octet rule.  In a line structure, each vertex or corner corresponds to a carbon atom.  Each line corresponds to a bond.  Because carbon follows the octet rule, each carbon atom with fewer than four explicitly drawn bonds must be connected to implicit hydrogen atoms.  The number of hydrogen atoms connected to each carbon is the number needed to get that carbon atom up to a full octet, or, in other words, four bonds total.
