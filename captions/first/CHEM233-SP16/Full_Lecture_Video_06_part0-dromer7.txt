compound characterization intro to spec
lets say I handed you this white powder and asked you to tell me what it was 
how would you go about doing that?
the process of identifying an unknown is called characterizing it 
when we characterize a compound we learn about its properties for example what you might do is melt this unknown powder and see if that melting point matches the melting point of any known compounds 
however as you might imagine their are many compounds in the world which have the same melting point so that on its own is not enough to figure out what it is 
another tool you could use is what we call spectroscopy 
spectroscopy is useful because it analyzes compounds on the molecular level 
there is no way for us to directly see what atoms make up a molecule and how those atoms are connected 
what we can do however is indirectly observe the molecule and how we do this is by seeing how the molecule interacts with various forms of energy 
what do i mean by indirectly observe? think about this analogy 
imagine you are in a hallway and the hallway has a corner and around that corner is an object of some kind you cannot see the object directly because the wall is in the way however if there is a mirror at the corner of the hallway you can use that mirror to indirectly view the object 
its a similar idea here 
we cannot view the molecule but we can view the energy that the molecule is interacting with 
a basic schematic of a spectroscopy experiment is shown here 
you have some kind of energy source. usually it is some form of light. we then take whatever energy we have selected and we shoot that energy at a sample of the compound we are trying to characterize. such as the white powder on the previous slide
the energy interacts with the sample in some way and then some energy is emitted 
that emitted energy is analyzed via a detector of some kind 
the detector then translates that information from the energy to give us data in some form usually in what we call a spectrum 
this spectrum organizes the information in a visual way that we can interpret
 we then take that data that spectrum and we analyze it and we interpret it to come to a conclusion 
hopefully the identity of the molecule
you will spend a significant amount of time in the early portion of this course interpreting various types of spectra 
it is likely that you have not seen anything like these spectra before 
but that is no reason to be worried, while these spectra may appear abstract to start with 
all spectra observe certain rules and you can use those rules to interpret them 
you should treat observing spectra very much like diagnosing a medical or engineering problem 
in many cases these types of problems are not directly observable but you can use multiple pieces of info to identify the problem anyway for example lets say you are a doctor and a patient comes to you with some symptoms a cough a fever something along those lines 
you cannot look at the patient and see the bacteria or the virus causing the illness the symptoms are an indirect way of observing the illness however the symptoms on their own are usually not enough to identify the illness you might run some blood tests and those blood tests come back and give you more information that is complementary to the symptoms that you already knew about. you then take the symptoms and the information you obtained from the blood tests and you can come up with a diagnosis 
in other words that was a logic puzzle. you took the information available and you came to a conclusion 
spectroscopy is the same way
you do not memorize spectra instead you will be exercising your critical thinking skills
in this course you will be given several different types of spectra and you will be asked to pull out information and then use that information make a conclusion of some kind usually identifying an unknown molecule
