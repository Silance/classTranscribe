We now know that the type of carbonyl matters a great deal. The stretch for most carbonyls will appear above 1700. Some carbonyls, carbonyls part of amides or carbons that are conjugated will appear below 1700 because of resonance. The resonance weakens the weakens the carbon oxygen double bond causing them to absorb light at lower wavenumbers. There is a C-C triple bond region at approximately 2200 wavenumbers. Now remember the C-C triple bond stretch might not appear or might be very weak if the bond is too symmetric. So always be careful when working in this region. C-H bond appear around 3000 wavenumbers and you know the type of C-H bond determines where it appears. C-H that are sp3 hybridized are below 3000. C-H that are sp2 hybridized are above 3000. And finally, O-H bonds and N-H bonds tend to appear around 3500 wavenumbers. They also tend to be sheep differently than most other stretches. In the next webcast, you will see examples of all these stretches. There you can see how shape can be used to identified stretches and you will see examples of how the same type of bond, say carbonyl or C-H bonds, can appear in different locations depending on the type of carbonyl or C-H bond.
