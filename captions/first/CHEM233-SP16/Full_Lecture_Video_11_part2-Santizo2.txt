Before we end this webcast, a note on NMR solvent. In an NMR experiment you usually take your compound and dissolve it into a solvent of some kind. A common solvent is Chloroform (CHCI3), because many compounds are soluble in chloroform, however you might notice a problem here chloroform contains one proton, that means chloroform will appear in the NMR spectrum. We do not want that because all we want to see in our NMR spectrum are signal that belong to the compound that we are examining. What can we do to get around this? What we can do it use deuterated solvents, in this example deuterated chloroform. Remember that deuterium is a hydrogen atom that contains both a proton and a neutron in the nucleus. How does going from a hydrogen atom which contains only one proton in the nucleus to another hydrogen atom that contains both a proton and neutron in the nucleus help us? Because the spin number of one deuterium is different that the spin number of one half for hydrogen. A deuterium atom will not interfere with a proton and NMR experiment. Therefore, by using deuterated solvents we can perform an NMR experiment without the solvent contaminated our NMR spectrum. Thats the end of this webcast, to recap proton NMR functions by placing molecules into a magnetic field and then irradiating those molecules with radio waves. Nuclei with particular spins for this course are the hydrogen nuclei and the carbon 13 nuclei align themselves mostly with the applied magnetic field. However, upon absorbing energy from the radio waves that are being irradiating with, those  nuclei flip spins to align against the applied magnetic field.Then the nuclei are allowed to relax, releasing energy that can analyzed to give us information about the molecule.
