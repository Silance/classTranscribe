[{"text":"hello welcome","width":63.18181824684143},{"text":"let's talk about how we can get single characters and print them out in c","width":187.18181824684143},{"text":"so here's some functions defined in std.io","width":177.18181824684143},{"text":"i can say give me a single character for example and why don't I just keep calling this","width":454.18181824684143},{"text":"so i could just say while getchar is not equal to a special constant called end of file (EOF) keep going around in a loop","width":473.18181824684143},{"text":"but if I actually want to print them out I better actually store the value of getchar","width":359.18181824684143},{"text":"so let's have an integer value called c and inside my while condition I'm actually going to assign the result into c","width":496.18181824684143},{"text":"so you'll often see this pattern inside systems programming where we take a systems call or a library call and we store the results inside a variable","width":675.1818182468414},{"text":"but because that may also signify an error condition or a termination condition we use it immediately to check inside part of a while loop or an if statement","width":605.1818182468414},{"text":"so we've got a little character loop here that is going to keep going until it gets to the end of the file","width":275.18181824684143},{"text":"so now I want to print it out","width":173.18181824684143},{"text":"guess what i can call putchat and we'll see that running ","width":203.18181824684143},{"text":"let's run this little program","width":181.18181824684143},{"text":"ABCD","width":128.18181824684143},{"text":"it prints back ABCD","width":123.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so we don't have to display the character just as a character","width":288.18181824684143},{"text":"we can display it as a character an integer and hexdecimal values","width":284.18181824684143},{"text":"so let's use printf for that","width":81.18181824684143},{"text":"i've got %c %d and %c for character integer and hexadecimal value","width":376.18181824684143},{"text":"alright so let's run this","width":145.18181824684143},{"text":"and you can see that the letter A corresponds to sixty five which is in hexadecimal forty one","width":552.1818182468414},{"text":"right so why don't we use our little program to print out the contents of another file","width":415.18181824684143},{"text":"so if I cat my source code I can see the contents of that","width":370.18181824684143},{"text":"great so I'm going to pipe it into my program","width":222.18181824684143},{"text":"so i'll do ./program and it reads every byte and prints it out as a character","width":493.18181824684143},{"text":"great so let's encrypt our file now so I'm going to modify our value of c if it's not a newline character","width":591.1818182468414},{"text":"so what we'll do is say if c is at least thirty two in other words at least a space an ascii space","width":425.18181824684143},{"text":"and if it is we will change the lowest bit","width":393.18181824684143},{"text":"we'll flip the lowest bit","width":96.18181824684143},{"text":"how can we do that","width":133.18181824684143},{"text":"let's xor it with one","width":120.18181824684143},{"text":"right and then we'll print it out","width":147.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so we'll run this","width":119.18181824684143},{"text":"CDE for example and it changed the C to a B","width":281.18181824684143},{"text":"and if I do 135 I get 024","width":254.18181824684143},{"text":"so to say that I've got to the end of the file when I'm just typing you by the way you can do control d","width":374.18181824684143},{"text":"now see this working on some actual source code","width":236.18181824684143},{"text":"so let's here some text my program.c and i'm going to pipe that into my program to use as its input","width":503.18181824684143},{"text":"and you can see great we've garbled the program","width":263.18181824684143},{"text":"so if I want to I can then take that output and pipe it into my program again","width":426.18181824684143},{"text":"so now i'm going to unencrypt it because i flipped the lowest bit back  ","width":315.18181824684143},{"text":"so we get back our source code","width":133.18181824684143},{"text":"so that's getchar and putchar i can also work with whole lines","width":285.18181824684143},{"text":"i can let's get rid of the loop here i can say puts hello or any pointer to a character array provided its terminated by a zero byte at the end","width":1063.1818182468414},{"text":"and that is equivalent to printf by saying %s and \\n at the end","width":516.1818182468414},{"text":"so i've got some character pointer here","width":323.18181824684143},{"text":"right so it's a little bit shorter to type than writing printf","width":359.18181824684143},{"text":"there is the opposite which is to get some input","width":264.18181824684143},{"text":"but this has a problem and we'll see why in a moment why this function call is actually being removed from the c standard","width":493.18181824684143},{"text":"i'm talking about gets so let's call gets and we will have a little buffer here","width":648.1818182468414},{"text":"so let's put a little buffer on the stack here","width":144.18181824684143},{"text":"i'll make it twelve bytes today ","width":171.18181824684143},{"text":"and remember when we call gets with buffer if you use the array name you are talking about the very first byte of the array","width":393.18181824684143},{"text":"and rather than printing out hello","width":120.18181824684143},{"text":"we will print out our buffer value","width":188.18181824684143},{"text":"so let's run this and we can type something in and it echos it back to us","width":509.18181824684143},{"text":"fantastic but what happens if we enter more than twelve bytes","width":262.18181824684143},{"text":"so in other words could something bad happen to our other variables","width":246.18181824684143},{"text":"well yes it could because if we go past twelve bytes we start writing into memory which is used for other purposes","width":353.18181824684143},{"text":"for example in my little program the integer is immediately after the buffer","width":378.18181824684143},{"text":"let's prove this let's set our hex value of c to be ten twenty thirty fourty","width":422.18181824684143},{"text":"let me print that out after we've called gets i'm going to print it again","width":508.18181824684143},{"text":"so we've got to remember that what we store is going to be our letters plus a null byte","width":572.1818182468414},{"text":"so in this case if I do ABCDABCDABCD I've already overflowed because the thirteenth byte is now going to be written into my integer","width":782.1818182468414},{"text":"but i am going to do just a few more I'll do ABCD there we go","width":295.18181824684143},{"text":"and we'll see that I've managed to change my integer value to 41424344","width":356.18181824684143},{"text":"so the last ABC that I wrote in there actually overran my buffer","width":347.18181824684143},{"text":"i've got a buffer overflow and I've corrupted the contents of another variable","width":269.18181824684143},{"text":"so that's why gets is dangerous","width":155.18181824684143},{"text":"there's no way to tell gets that we shouldn't accept input that is too long for it","width":389.18181824684143},{"text":"so in a future video i'll tell you about getline and also fgets which don't suffer from these problems","width":555.1818182468414},{"text":"okay that's it for me thanks for watching and i'll see you in another video. bye!","width":333.18181824684143}]
