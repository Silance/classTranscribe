### What do I have to do?

Depending on the class you will either be emailed a specific task or given a 
link where you can access a task at any point. All you need to do is type what
you hear and then press 'submit transcription'!

### How do I know if my task was submitted succesfully?

You can check your progress at http://classtranscribe.com/progress/CLASS_NAME. Note that this is temporarily unavailable, but will be fixed shortly. However, if you transcribed everything then your work will be saved and you shouldn't worry about this.

### My assigned video doesn't have sound at the start.

The videos are split and trimmed automatically by identifying noise. This means if there is a spike of noise, then some amount of silence and finally the lecture the silence in between the noise will be captured. Please just skip ahead to the start of talking and then start transcribing.

### My assigned video doesn't have sound at all.

Occasionally there are issues with the microphone that may cause a lecture recording to have no audio. Given the largely automated process these aren't always picked up beforehand. Please email (below) to notify us of the issue.
